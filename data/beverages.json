What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/iJSTe8HZQUiOrziin6ng_yilo orange mango.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Orange Mango Potion 100mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[{"id":110908,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/iJSTe8HZQUiOrziin6ng_yilo orange mango.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"100","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":58004,"slug":"keef-brands-keef-cola-purple-passion-soda-100mg-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":[],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":{"cartQuantity":1,"cartUnit":"each","cbdPips":null,"deal":null,"dispensary":{"id":27915,"slug":"emerald-gilbert","address1":"175 S.

We are working hard each day to minimize risk during this critical time by working closely with local and state governments, implementing new procedures and policies at our dispensaries, and responding as quickly as possible to the evolving situation.\n\nOur previous commitments remain, with a new addition that our first operating hour of each day (8am-9am) is now prioritized for patients 60 years of age or older.  We appreciate everyone's support and understanding of this additional preventive measure.\n\n\nSAVE SOME FOR EVERYONE\nEveryone has seen the pictures of empty shelves in this time of panic purchasing, and medical marijuana supplies are not immune to this type of shopping behavior.\n\nSince cannabis is a medical necessity for our patients, and we don’t want these uncertain times to affect our ability to provide quality medicine to patients when they need it, we will temporarily be reducing daily specials in an effort to discourage this type of mass purchasing. We may also place limits on the number of specific items each patient can purchase on an as-needed basis to ensure we have medicine for patients when they need it.\n\nWe appreciate your patience and understanding in these unprecedented times. We continue to strive to provide the best service and selection of medical cannabis to our Arizona MMJ Community every day.\n\nWe’re here for you and we’re in this together.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/c9DHfsrrQ5Wxuvbp8spT_yilo logo.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Raspberry Tea Hybrid 100mg ","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[{"id":171845,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/c9DHfsrrQ5Wxuvbp8spT_yilo logo.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"100","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":295811,"slug":"baked-bros-adult-use-mango-thc-syrup-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":[],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":{"cartQuantity":1,"cartUnit":"each","cbdPips":null,"deal":{"id":146798,"active":true,"buyQuantity":null,"daysOfWeek":["monday","saturday"],"discountAmount":30,"discountType":"percent","discountedPrice":1421,"dispensaryTimeZone":"America/Phoenix","endsAt":"2021-12-31T07:00:00Z","finePrint":null,"getQuantity":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/deal-presets/GENERIC_30Percentoff_v010.jpg","isMedical":true,"isRecreational":true,"kind":"sale","lastModified":"2021-12-02T01:11:37.394Z","limitPerOrder":null,"shortDisplayTitle":null,"sortOrder":24,"startsAt":"2021-12-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"30% Off Baked Bros","totalSavings":609},"dispensary":{"id":185866,"slug":"the-good-dispensary","address1":"1842 W Broadway","address2":null,"city":"Mesa","country":"US","coverPhotoUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dispensary/logos/1x9UV2CpSS6eNKwoe84f_LEAFLY-1.jpg","deliveryEnabled":true,"description":"Welcome Home!

This product is a dual intake medication, for the body can absorb the medication buccally through the membranes in the gums and cheeks as well as through the process of the liver.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/snqoGwjMS6KsYeZ9EJhz_Happy-Hour-Citrus-Punch---Front-Back.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Haze & Main Happy Hour Citrus Punch Energy Drink 100mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US"],"photos":[{"id":210501,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/snqoGwjMS6KsYeZ9EJhz_Happy-Hour-Citrus-Punch---Front-Back.jpg","orderNumber":0},{"id":210557,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/jqJe28YtQ0C7mQ9tmFYx_Happy-Hour---Nutrition-Label-(1).jpg","orderNumber":1},{"id":210558,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/WoMLhSRQ7KdYwtGWq77r_Happy-Hour---Nutrition-Label-(1).jpg","orderNumber":2}],"shortDescription":"75mg THC, 25mg CBD, 80mg Caffeine per can.","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"0","thcContentType":"none","thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/snqoGwjMS6KsYeZ9EJhz_Happy-Hour-Citrus-Punch---Front-Back.jpg","videoUrl":null},{"id":295812,"slug":"baked-bros-adult-use-unflavored-thc-syrup-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":[],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":{"cartQuantity":1,"cartUnit":"each","cbdPips":null,"deal":{"id":146798,"active":true,"buyQuantity":null,"daysOfWeek":["monday","saturday"],"discountAmount":30,"discountType":"percent","discountedPrice":1421,"dispensaryTimeZone":"America/Phoenix","endsAt":"2021-12-31T07:00:00Z","finePrint":null,"getQuantity":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/deal-presets/GENERIC_30Percentoff_v010.jpg","isMedical":true,"isRecreational":true,"kind":"sale","lastModified":"2021-12-02T01:11:37.394Z","limitPerOrder":null,"shortDisplayTitle":null,"sortOrder":24,"startsAt":"2021-12-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"30% Off Baked Bros","totalSavings":609},"dispensary":{"id":185866,"slug":"the-good-dispensary","address1":"1842 W Broadway","address2":null,"city":"Mesa","country":"US","coverPhotoUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dispensary/logos/1x9UV2CpSS6eNKwoe84f_LEAFLY-1.jpg","deliveryEnabled":true,"description":"Welcome Home!

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/c9DHfsrrQ5Wxuvbp8spT_yilo logo.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Blueberry Tea 100mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[{"id":171797,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/c9DHfsrrQ5Wxuvbp8spT_yilo logo.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"100","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":192696,"slug":"wyld-cbd-cbd-raspberry-sparkling-water-25mg-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Oregon"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":{"cartQuantity":1,"cartUnit":"each","cbdPips":null,"deal":null,"dispensary":{"id":28939,"slug":"medmen-scottsdale-talking-stick-manzanita","address1":"8729 E.

California Dreamin’ infused drinks are delightfully flavored and consistently potent beverages --  the ideal way to enjoy cannabis. California Dreamin’ hand selects every flavor and hand bottles every drink in sunny California. Think of them as bottled, refreshing sunshine.\n\nMission:\nThe California Dreamin’ team started brewing delectable sparkling juices in early 2017 when the founders noticed that most of their friends were intimidated by the potency of current edible products on the market. The founders knew that while Southern California is incredibly lucky to be the epicenter of the best flower, concentrates, and edibles in the world, many patients wanted a lighter experience or simply had a low tolerance for cannabinoids. The team put their collective heads together, and decided to craft a cannabis-infused product that embodied everything about their beloved Golden State. Thus, California Dreamin’ was born, ready to refresh customers and offer delicious,  reliably dosed juices for its patients.\n\nProducts:\nCalifornia Dreamin’ delivers experiences that patients with any level of tolerance can enjoy. Sparkling juices are a fun, healthy, and refreshing way to enjoy cannabis without smoke or added sugar. To craft their beverages, California Dreamin’ beverage makers carefully blend cannabis tincture using their proprietary process, which guarantees accurate and consistent dosing.

It's the union of all ingredients such as the coffee beans, chamomile tea and blueberries that brings harmony within the blend.\n \nSourced locally and globally, we are obsessed with finding the best ingredients and meeting the people behind them that grow the raw goods. Trust is established and friendships are fostered with the farmers, roasters and suppliers that makeup the finer pieces that create our products.  \n \nThis is the essence of our culture:  It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way that allows us to create the experience of marQaha.\n \n\"In every chain of reasoning, the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that of the weakest link\nof the chain, whatever may be the strength of the rest.\"\n \nThomas Reid, circa 1786\n \n \n \nTrue To The Plant\n \n \nmarQaha has created whole plant extracted products since 2010, well before this was a globally preferred way to present cannabis as medicine. We recognized that, while this plant is medicinal it has also been used spiritually and recreationally for thousands of years. Given the spectrum of uses (sometimes many at the same time) we see the overall use as being therapeutic. \n \nmarQaha’s approach when creating a product is to combine, represent and elevate the most powerful components of each ingredient so they work in concert together. Terpenes are one of the more amazing elements that we choose to elevate. For example, our Blueberry Chamomile flasQ is designed to not only represent the whole cannabis plant but also elevates the whole plant profile and terpenes of the blueberry and chamomile plant.\n \nThere are 100's of potentially different compounds present in the plant, it's the interaction of these various compounds in cannabis that is known as the ‘entourage effect', here’s how it works. Cannabis contains 100's of chemical compounds. Researchers have identified over 60 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC,CBD and CBG. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant that also have regulatory effects. For example, terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. While THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in cannabis work together to produce this synergy of \"entourage\" effects. \n \nCannabis comes in thousands of different varieties, or strains. Different cannabis strains have vastly different chemical profiles that cause different experiences in the same person. This explains why sometimes cannabis can make a person feel calm, while other times it can make that same person feel anxious or paranoid. The chemical components of cannabis include, but are not limited to, terpenes, ketones, esters, lactones, alcohols, fatty acids, and steroids. The effects of all these chemicals working together and regulating each other will be much different than the effects of any one chemical working alone. Cannabis is made up of thousands of different chemicals that work together that creates a particular effect. Change the combination and you have a different effect, some of them are small while others are significant. This is the power of the plant and it's real potential!\n \n\"It's been proven by quite a few studies that plants are good for our psychological development. If you green an area, the rate of crime goes down. Torture victims begin to recover when they spend time outside in a garden with flowers. So we need them, in some deep psychological sense, which I don't suppose anybody really understands yet.\"\n \nJane Goodall\n \n \nSo what does this word mean you ask?\n \n \nmarQaha is a very old Arabic word that refers to the “bliss” felt while drinking coffee, it has also come to mean “someone or something impossible to hate”. \n \n \n \nHistory and Beyond\n \nFounded in 2010, marQaha is one of the oldest and most trusted companies in the industry. Since this time we have heard many amazing stories, met amazing people and are still learning much about the plant. We are looking forward to continuing this journey together.","informationWebsite":"http://www.marqaha.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/KJfr5LyHS4Oi2GFqKIaW_6-Inch-marQaha-sticker.png","name":"marQaha","tagline":"Take Flight"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"100","cbdContentType":"mg","countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"This is our balanced 1:1 THC to CBD flasQ.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":null,"hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.imgix.net/shared-web-images/product-type-icons/menu_edibles.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Potion (Strawberry Mango) Sativa","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[],"shortDescription":null,"strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":303434,"slug":"rebel-coast-sparkling-sauvage-2019-cannabis-infused-beverage-10mg-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["California"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":22959,"slug":"rebel-coast","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"  ","informationWebsite":"","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Rebel Coast","tagline":""},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":null,"hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/products/photos/dpP1FKWrTxmPFjjj6mEF_Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 3.51.28 PM.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Sparkling Sauvage 2019 Cannabis Infused Beverage 10mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-CA"],"photos":[{"id":230519,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/products/photos/dpP1FKWrTxmPFjjj6mEF_Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 3.51.28 PM.png","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":null,"strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"10","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":189988,"slug":"dixie-cherry-limeade-200mg-candy","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Maryland","California","Colorado","Michigan","Nevada","Oklahoma","Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":10,"slug":"dixie","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Dixie is the trusted source for innovative, safe, effective and delicious cannabis products.

Ben-David not so much. So how did this new line of Energy, Focus, and Relief products come about?\r\n\r\nAre you old enough to remember to Reese’s peanut butter cup commercials? “Wow you got peanut butter in my chocolate!” “No you got chocolate in my peanut butter!” Two great ingredients that together make for an even better taste experience.\r\n\r\nNow as your reading this you have to be wondering what the heck does any of that have to do with Health Supplements!\r\n\r\nGrab a seat and a Jane’s Brew and hear our story:\r\n\r\nI’m Ben-David Sheppard, a very active father of 3, I coach my boys in football and lacrosse. I am also the CEO the House of Jane. My boys and I live on the east coast and all of my businesses are on the west coast. Coaching, working and traveling were beating the hell out of me. On top of all that I had recently separated, my right shoulder, and tore my tendon in my left arm in a bad fall. So opening a door, reaching for anything, trying to throw a football were extremely painful if not impossible. I was incapable of using my left arm and right shoulder. I visited two specialist one being the team physician for an NFL team. She gave me 3 options:\r\n\r\nSurgery\r\nPain medication—not an option due to the fog, lack of focus and addictive effects caused by pain meds\r\nStrengthen both areas thru working out, and suck it up and endure the pain and discomfort.\r\nSo option 3 it was:\r\n\r\nDay one I could not do a push up, and at night I could not sleep from the pain and the soreness from my working out. I tried night time Tylenol for sleep and woke up groggy and seemed to have problems with recall during the day. So what to do ? Here I was involved in the cannabis business so that was a possible solution, however I did not want to have any psychoactive reactions during the day. I was stubborn, sore, tired, beat up, miserable, refusing to take big pharmaceutical addictive pain killing or sleep walking drugs or cannabis with THC.\r\n\r\nOk back to the Reese’s commercial, I was looking for a boost of energy and was given some B-12 Caffeinated Energy capsules, took them for focus and a boost of energy. They worked great for focus and energy, but with them came the jitters heart palpitations and then a hard crash. At night I needed to get some sleep being so tired, and sore after working out. So I thought I would go to Jill and our Cannabis team, and see what she and they, may suggest I try to help with sleep and ease the pain to relax. Their recommendation was unanimous “CBD”! So the next day before my work out I took my B-12 energy capsule and a dose of CBD for my pain and for anti-inflammation.","informationWebsite":"https://thehouseofjane.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/It4GmHHoQM6HGGD2bD1e_H8BF6UXn_400x400.png","name":"House of Jane","tagline":"Health & Energy Supplements"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/IDlHn7lZThW1wewW5TSt","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Green Tea 20mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[{"id":146704,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/IDlHn7lZThW1wewW5TSt","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"0","thcContentType":"none","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":104890,"slug":"utopia-sparkling-waterz-cherry-sparkling-water-10mg-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":14091,"slug":"utopia-sparkling-waterz","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Utopia Sparkling Water","tagline":null},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"The taste of juicy cherries add a hint of sweetness round out this buzz-inducing sparkling water.

We support your personal journey by offering you this amazing plant embraced over thousands of years in a variety of ways. Medical, Spiritual or Therapeutic it offers so much and asks for so little in return. \n \n \nRespect\n \n \nTake it in and  Take Flight\n \nBring the plant in, Breathe and enjoy the new path that just opened up.\n \n \nMission\n \n \n \nmarQaha means bliss: We bring you closer to finding, achieving and maintaining the Plant's purpose in your life and the Bliss that comes through this relationship.\n \nIt is this union that is marQaha\n \nOne Planet many Plants: Cannabis offers something to everyone, we make it better by blending it with other power plants and ingredients so they work in concert together. Our speciality is the creation of different ingestible forms that harnesses the power of nature.\n \n \n \n“You are that vast thing that you see far, far off with great telescopes.”\n \nAlan Watts\n \n \nCraftsmanship\n \nHands on, small-batched perfection\n \n \nWe bring years of experience into each day. This is a delicate balance of hands-on production and verified lab results to confirm the consistency of each crafted batch. Repetition is the mother of perfection. Our processes are repeated hundreds of times a day and refined over years.  This is slow, deliberate perfection.\n \n \n“It's the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. And once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen.”\n \nMuhammad Ali\n \n \nThe sum of the parts\n \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link\n \n \nEach product we design requires so much more than cannabis to create something extraordinary. It's the union of all ingredients such as the coffee beans, chamomile tea and blueberries that brings harmony within the blend.\n \nSourced locally and globally, we are obsessed with finding the best ingredients and meeting the people behind them that grow the raw goods. Trust is established and friendships are fostered with the farmers, roasters and suppliers that makeup the finer pieces that create our products.  \n \nThis is the essence of our culture:  It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way that allows us to create the experience of marQaha.\n \n\"In every chain of reasoning, the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that of the weakest link\nof the chain, whatever may be the strength of the rest.\"\n \nThomas Reid, circa 1786\n \n \n \nTrue To The Plant\n \n \nmarQaha has created whole plant extracted products since 2010, well before this was a globally preferred way to present cannabis as medicine. We recognized that, while this plant is medicinal it has also been used spiritually and recreationally for thousands of years. Given the spectrum of uses (sometimes many at the same time) we see the overall use as being therapeutic. \n \nmarQaha’s approach when creating a product is to combine, represent and elevate the most powerful components of each ingredient so they work in concert together. Terpenes are one of the more amazing elements that we choose to elevate. For example, our Blueberry Chamomile flasQ is designed to not only represent the whole cannabis plant but also elevates the whole plant profile and terpenes of the blueberry and chamomile plant.\n \nThere are 100's of potentially different compounds present in the plant, it's the interaction of these various compounds in cannabis that is known as the ‘entourage effect', here’s how it works. Cannabis contains 100's of chemical compounds. Researchers have identified over 60 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC,CBD and CBG. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant that also have regulatory effects. For example, terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. While THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in cannabis work together to produce this synergy of \"entourage\" effects. \n \nCannabis comes in thousands of different varieties, or strains. Different cannabis strains have vastly different chemical profiles that cause different experiences in the same person. This explains why sometimes cannabis can make a person feel calm, while other times it can make that same person feel anxious or paranoid. The chemical components of cannabis include, but are not limited to, terpenes, ketones, esters, lactones, alcohols, fatty acids, and steroids. The effects of all these chemicals working together and regulating each other will be much different than the effects of any one chemical working alone. Cannabis is made up of thousands of different chemicals that work together that creates a particular effect. Change the combination and you have a different effect, some of them are small while others are significant. This is the power of the plant and it's real potential!\n \n\"It's been proven by quite a few studies that plants are good for our psychological development. If you green an area, the rate of crime goes down. Torture victims begin to recover when they spend time outside in a garden with flowers. So we need them, in some deep psychological sense, which I don't suppose anybody really understands yet.\"\n \nJane Goodall\n \n \nSo what does this word mean you ask?\n \n \nmarQaha is a very old Arabic word that refers to the “bliss” felt while drinking coffee, it has also come to mean “someone or something impossible to hate”. \n \n \n \nHistory and Beyond\n \nFounded in 2010, marQaha is one of the oldest and most trusted companies in the industry. Since this time we have heard many amazing stories, met amazing people and are still learning much about the plant. We are looking forward to continuing this journey together.","informationWebsite":"http://www.marqaha.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/KJfr5LyHS4Oi2GFqKIaW_6-Inch-marQaha-sticker.png","name":"marQaha","tagline":"Take Flight"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"Wake and Bake, coffee done the cold way blended with 100 MG of THC!

All of our products are made in-house using a proprietary extraction process that is completely free of any non-medicinal plant constituents and high-quality organic ingredients. Our products are Vegan and GMO Free.\r\n\r\nEach batch of essential cannabis oil produced is tested both on and offsite to ensure that every dose our customers ingest is pure and safe, and delivers the same level of relief every time. From hard candies, suckers and capsules to oral sprays and tinctures, our confections are known for their delicious flavors, long-lasting effects and minimal cannabis flavor.\r\n\r\nAt Canyon Cultivation, we take extreme pride in the high-quality, infused products we create. However, we did not want to create products that just taste good. We wanted to raise the bar and develop something that no other manufacturer is currently producing . We wanted to introduce a line of boutique products that were completely free of synthetic ingredients or petroleum distillates, such as butane or propane.\r\n\r\nWe use only co2 to extract our cannabis essential oil from organic plant materials, making it entirely safe for consumption. \r\n\r\nIn addition to our unique cannabis oil, Canyon Cultivation’s edibles are made with all-natural or organic ingredients that are sourced locally whenever possible.\r\n\r\nCanyon Cultivation was developed by two generations of idealists living in the mountain canyons of Colorado. And like many innovators before us, our business began in the small confines of my parent’s basement with nothing more than passion, determination and vision.\r\n\r\nOur mission was two-fold: To develop a line of wholesome cannabis-infused products that were flavorful, discreet, and accurately medicated, as well as become pioneers in Ethanol based concentrates. This was no small feat, but after much adversity we succeeded and our unique line of edibles made their official debut in 2011.\r\n\r\nIn just a few short years, we have grown to be one of the leading manufacturers of infused edibles in Colorado and we have no intention of stopping there. We have several new and exciting ventures on the horizon and we look forward to sharing this journey with you. Thank you for your continued support.","informationWebsite":"http://www.canyonthc.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/ev5AG8yNSxqHHIciMwf2_Screen%20Shot%202020-04-03%20at%207.26.19%20AM.png","name":"Canyon Cultivation","tagline":"Handcraft Cannabis and CBD Edibles.

States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"YiLo is the result of our quest to create the finest medicated chocolates, drinks, brownies, candies and snacks for medical marijuana patients. What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD.

Its bitter flavor was masked by native herbs and spices until the addition of sugar, which was introduced by the Europeans.\n\nWe use our proprietary organic spice blend of Cinnamon, Nutmeg, and Cayenne Pepper in combination with that Peruvian Chocolate we referenced previously.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":null,"hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.imgix.net/shared-web-images/product-type-icons/menu_edibles.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Tea (Raspberry) Indica","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[],"shortDescription":null,"strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":240230,"slug":"outlaw-edibles-woozie-single-shot-100mg-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Oklahoma"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":7819,"slug":"outlaw-edibles","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Outlaw Edibles","tagline":null},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/tMzasBZjTFeiJSPugW5O_Woozie-Oil-Pour.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Woozie Single Shot 100mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-OK"],"photos":[{"id":170017,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/tMzasBZjTFeiJSPugW5O_Woozie-Oil-Pour.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"100","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":47997,"slug":"baked-bros-thc-syrup-mango","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Arizona"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":207,"slug":"baked-bros","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Baked Bros Mission:\nAt Baked Bros™, our mission is to enrich the quality of life of our diverse patients by providing consistently dosed, strain-specific, high-quality medicine in the cannabis community.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/YqK5RksETZe97jkXy497_Yilo Orange Mango Potion.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Orange Mango Potion Sativa 400mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[{"id":117466,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/YqK5RksETZe97jkXy497_Yilo Orange Mango Potion.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"400","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":111184,"slug":"us-cannabis-orange-oklahoma-tonic-200mg-2oz-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Oklahoma"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":10235,"slug":"us-cannabis","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"US Cannabis","informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"US Cannabis Pharma (USCP)","tagline":"US Cannabis"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"Oklahoma Tonic is a Water-Soluble THC infused syrup that can be mixed with your beverage of choice or drank straight from the bottle.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/menu-items/photos/hOb22e9vQd6nUn4u0DfI_3KnVLGw9Ta2yDTdRo3sz.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Indica Caramel Coffee 25mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[{"id":120268,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/menu-items/photos/hOb22e9vQd6nUn4u0DfI_3KnVLGw9Ta2yDTdRo3sz.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"25","thcContentType":"percent","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":104889,"slug":"utopia-sparkling-waterz-cherry-sparkling-water-30mg-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":14091,"slug":"utopia-sparkling-waterz","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Utopia Sparkling Water","tagline":null},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"The taste of juicy cherries add a hint of sweetness round out this buzz-inducing sparkling water.

We support your personal journey by offering you this amazing plant embraced over thousands of years in a variety of ways. Medical, Spiritual or Therapeutic it offers so much and asks for so little in return. \n \n \nRespect\n \n \nTake it in and  Take Flight\n \nBring the plant in, Breathe and enjoy the new path that just opened up.\n \n \nMission\n \n \n \nmarQaha means bliss: We bring you closer to finding, achieving and maintaining the Plant's purpose in your life and the Bliss that comes through this relationship.\n \nIt is this union that is marQaha\n \nOne Planet many Plants: Cannabis offers something to everyone, we make it better by blending it with other power plants and ingredients so they work in concert together. Our speciality is the creation of different ingestible forms that harnesses the power of nature.\n \n \n \n“You are that vast thing that you see far, far off with great telescopes.”\n \nAlan Watts\n \n \nCraftsmanship\n \nHands on, small-batched perfection\n \n \nWe bring years of experience into each day. This is a delicate balance of hands-on production and verified lab results to confirm the consistency of each crafted batch. Repetition is the mother of perfection. Our processes are repeated hundreds of times a day and refined over years.  This is slow, deliberate perfection.\n \n \n“It's the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. And once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen.”\n \nMuhammad Ali\n \n \nThe sum of the parts\n \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link\n \n \nEach product we design requires so much more than cannabis to create something extraordinary. It's the union of all ingredients such as the coffee beans, chamomile tea and blueberries that brings harmony within the blend.\n \nSourced locally and globally, we are obsessed with finding the best ingredients and meeting the people behind them that grow the raw goods. Trust is established and friendships are fostered with the farmers, roasters and suppliers that makeup the finer pieces that create our products.  \n \nThis is the essence of our culture:  It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way that allows us to create the experience of marQaha.\n \n\"In every chain of reasoning, the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that of the weakest link\nof the chain, whatever may be the strength of the rest.\"\n \nThomas Reid, circa 1786\n \n \n \nTrue To The Plant\n \n \nmarQaha has created whole plant extracted products since 2010, well before this was a globally preferred way to present cannabis as medicine. We recognized that, while this plant is medicinal it has also been used spiritually and recreationally for thousands of years. Given the spectrum of uses (sometimes many at the same time) we see the overall use as being therapeutic. \n \nmarQaha’s approach when creating a product is to combine, represent and elevate the most powerful components of each ingredient so they work in concert together. Terpenes are one of the more amazing elements that we choose to elevate. For example, our Blueberry Chamomile flasQ is designed to not only represent the whole cannabis plant but also elevates the whole plant profile and terpenes of the blueberry and chamomile plant.\n \nThere are 100's of potentially different compounds present in the plant, it's the interaction of these various compounds in cannabis that is known as the ‘entourage effect', here’s how it works. Cannabis contains 100's of chemical compounds. Researchers have identified over 60 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC,CBD and CBG. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant that also have regulatory effects. For example, terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. While THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in cannabis work together to produce this synergy of \"entourage\" effects. \n \nCannabis comes in thousands of different varieties, or strains. Different cannabis strains have vastly different chemical profiles that cause different experiences in the same person. This explains why sometimes cannabis can make a person feel calm, while other times it can make that same person feel anxious or paranoid. The chemical components of cannabis include, but are not limited to, terpenes, ketones, esters, lactones, alcohols, fatty acids, and steroids. The effects of all these chemicals working together and regulating each other will be much different than the effects of any one chemical working alone. Cannabis is made up of thousands of different chemicals that work together that creates a particular effect. Change the combination and you have a different effect, some of them are small while others are significant. This is the power of the plant and it's real potential!\n \n\"It's been proven by quite a few studies that plants are good for our psychological development. If you green an area, the rate of crime goes down. Torture victims begin to recover when they spend time outside in a garden with flowers. So we need them, in some deep psychological sense, which I don't suppose anybody really understands yet.\"\n \nJane Goodall\n \n \nSo what does this word mean you ask?\n \n \nmarQaha is a very old Arabic word that refers to the “bliss” felt while drinking coffee, it has also come to mean “someone or something impossible to hate”. \n \n \n \nHistory and Beyond\n \nFounded in 2010, marQaha is one of the oldest and most trusted companies in the industry. Since this time we have heard many amazing stories, met amazing people and are still learning much about the plant. We are looking forward to continuing this journey together.","informationWebsite":"http://www.marqaha.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/KJfr5LyHS4Oi2GFqKIaW_6-Inch-marQaha-sticker.png","name":"marQaha","tagline":"Take Flight"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"mg","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"To help spread the word about marQaha we decided to create a simple energy shot.

Think of them as bottled, refreshing sunshine.\n\nMission:\nThe California Dreamin’ team started brewing delectable sparkling juices in early 2017 when the founders noticed that most of their friends were intimidated by the potency of current edible products on the market. The founders knew that while Southern California is incredibly lucky to be the epicenter of the best flower, concentrates, and edibles in the world, many patients wanted a lighter experience or simply had a low tolerance for cannabinoids. The team put their collective heads together, and decided to craft a cannabis-infused product that embodied everything about their beloved Golden State. Thus, California Dreamin’ was born, ready to refresh customers and offer delicious,  reliably dosed juices for its patients.\n\nProducts:\nCalifornia Dreamin’ delivers experiences that patients with any level of tolerance can enjoy.

California Dreamin’ infused drinks are delightfully flavored and consistently potent beverages --  the ideal way to enjoy cannabis. California Dreamin’ hand selects every flavor and hand bottles every drink in sunny California. Think of them as bottled, refreshing sunshine.\n\nMission:\nThe California Dreamin’ team started brewing delectable sparkling juices in early 2017 when the founders noticed that most of their friends were intimidated by the potency of current edible products on the market. The founders knew that while Southern California is incredibly lucky to be the epicenter of the best flower, concentrates, and edibles in the world, many patients wanted a lighter experience or simply had a low tolerance for cannabinoids. The team put their collective heads together, and decided to craft a cannabis-infused product that embodied everything about their beloved Golden State. Thus, California Dreamin’ was born, ready to refresh customers and offer delicious,  reliably dosed juices for its patients.\n\nProducts:\nCalifornia Dreamin’ delivers experiences that patients with any level of tolerance can enjoy. Sparkling juices are a fun, healthy, and refreshing way to enjoy cannabis without smoke or added sugar. To craft their beverages, California Dreamin’ beverage makers carefully blend cannabis tincture using their proprietary process, which guarantees accurate and consistent dosing. California Dreamin’s ingredients are all naturally sourced, and all its flavors are inspired by the bounty of California.  Whether it’s a sweet sparkling Tangerine drink or a tart, bubbly Pomegranate beverage, patients can rest assured that there are zero artificial ingredients, no added sugar, and no mysterious dosing.   \n\nLab Testing:\nQuality and consistency are California Dreamin’s top priorities. The team performs comprehensive testing through Pharmalabs on their extracts and beverages to guarantee potency and deliver safe, healthy drinks free of pesticides, microbes, and other unwanted agents.","informationWebsite":"http://www.drinkdreamin.com","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/gQU416fjRaK0jeVegplI_logo-medium.jpg","name":"California Dreamin'","tagline":"Share a dream with us"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"","cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/wAFriyjQT2wkDAXDOwln_caldreamin-tangerine-031218.png","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":8,"name":"California Dreamin' Tangerine 10mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-CA"],"photos":[{"id":24184,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/wAFriyjQT2wkDAXDOwln_caldreamin-tangerine-031218.png","orderNumber":2}],"shortDescription":"Sparkling tangerine juice with 10mg infused THC per 11.2oz bottle","strain":{"slug":"j1","id":624,"aka":"J-1, j 1, Jack One, Jack 1","averageRating":null,"cannabinoidDataProducerCount":null,"cannabinoids":null,"category":"Hybrid","chemotype":null,"description":null,"descriptionPlain":null,"distanceMi":null,"effects":null,"energizeScore":null,"flowerImagePng":null,"flowerImageSvg":null,"name":"J1","nucleusImagePng":null,"nucleusImageSvg":null,"nugImage":null,"nugImageAltText":null,"phenotype":"Hybrid","populationRank":480,"reviewCount":null,"shortDescriptionPlain":null,"stockNugImage":null,"strainId":624,"subtitle":null,"symbol":null,"terpeneDataProducerCount":null,"terps":null,"topEffect":null,"topTerp":null},"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"","thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/wAFriyjQT2wkDAXDOwln_caldreamin-tangerine-031218.png","videoUrl":null},{"id":14670,"slug":"ganja-grindz-coffee-company-brew-cup-roastmasters-blend-coffee","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Arizona","California","Oregon"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":4173,"slug":"ganja-grindz-coffee-company","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"At Ganja Grindz Coffee Company, our culinary experts and food scientists have spent countless hours grinding away to provide you with the highest quality cannabis infused bottled coffees, bottled apple ciders, bottled teas, tea bags, coffee filters and brew cups on the market.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD.

All of our products are made in-house using a proprietary extraction process that is completely free of any non-medicinal plant constituents and high-quality organic ingredients. Our products are Vegan and GMO Free.\r\n\r\nEach batch of essential cannabis oil produced is tested both on and offsite to ensure that every dose our customers ingest is pure and safe, and delivers the same level of relief every time. From hard candies, suckers and capsules to oral sprays and tinctures, our confections are known for their delicious flavors, long-lasting effects and minimal cannabis flavor.\r\n\r\nAt Canyon Cultivation, we take extreme pride in the high-quality, infused products we create. However, we did not want to create products that just taste good. We wanted to raise the bar and develop something that no other manufacturer is currently producing . We wanted to introduce a line of boutique products that were completely free of synthetic ingredients or petroleum distillates, such as butane or propane.\r\n\r\nWe use only co2 to extract our cannabis essential oil from organic plant materials, making it entirely safe for consumption. \r\n\r\nIn addition to our unique cannabis oil, Canyon Cultivation’s edibles are made with all-natural or organic ingredients that are sourced locally whenever possible.\r\n\r\nCanyon Cultivation was developed by two generations of idealists living in the mountain canyons of Colorado. And like many innovators before us, our business began in the small confines of my parent’s basement with nothing more than passion, determination and vision.\r\n\r\nOur mission was two-fold: To develop a line of wholesome cannabis-infused products that were flavorful, discreet, and accurately medicated, as well as become pioneers in Ethanol based concentrates. This was no small feat, but after much adversity we succeeded and our unique line of edibles made their official debut in 2011.\r\n\r\nIn just a few short years, we have grown to be one of the leading manufacturers of infused edibles in Colorado and we have no intention of stopping there. We have several new and exciting ventures on the horizon and we look forward to sharing this journey with you. Thank you for your continued support.","informationWebsite":"http://www.canyonthc.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/ev5AG8yNSxqHHIciMwf2_Screen%20Shot%202020-04-03%20at%207.26.19%20AM.png","name":"Canyon Cultivation","tagline":"Handcraft Cannabis and CBD Edibles.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/2QXzG4GTSNOpdIhSF3Zu","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Strawberry Mango Potion Sativa 25mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[{"id":132827,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/2QXzG4GTSNOpdIhSF3Zu","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"25","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":37695,"slug":"olala-blue-raspberry-soda","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":3143,"slug":"olala","availableCountries":["Canada","United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Yummy cannabis-infused sodas in 10 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg varietals, along with Co2-extracted, terpene-rich concentrates from the best farms in the state!

We support your personal journey by offering you this amazing plant embraced over thousands of years in a variety of ways. Medical, Spiritual or Therapeutic it offers so much and asks for so little in return. \n \n \nRespect\n \n \nTake it in and  Take Flight\n \nBring the plant in, Breathe and enjoy the new path that just opened up.\n \n \nMission\n \n \n \nmarQaha means bliss: We bring you closer to finding, achieving and maintaining the Plant's purpose in your life and the Bliss that comes through this relationship.\n \nIt is this union that is marQaha\n \nOne Planet many Plants: Cannabis offers something to everyone, we make it better by blending it with other power plants and ingredients so they work in concert together. Our speciality is the creation of different ingestible forms that harnesses the power of nature.\n \n \n \n“You are that vast thing that you see far, far off with great telescopes.”\n \nAlan Watts\n \n \nCraftsmanship\n \nHands on, small-batched perfection\n \n \nWe bring years of experience into each day. This is a delicate balance of hands-on production and verified lab results to confirm the consistency of each crafted batch. Repetition is the mother of perfection. Our processes are repeated hundreds of times a day and refined over years.  This is slow, deliberate perfection.\n \n \n“It's the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. And once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen.”\n \nMuhammad Ali\n \n \nThe sum of the parts\n \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link\n \n \nEach product we design requires so much more than cannabis to create something extraordinary. It's the union of all ingredients such as the coffee beans, chamomile tea and blueberries that brings harmony within the blend.\n \nSourced locally and globally, we are obsessed with finding the best ingredients and meeting the people behind them that grow the raw goods. Trust is established and friendships are fostered with the farmers, roasters and suppliers that makeup the finer pieces that create our products.  \n \nThis is the essence of our culture:  It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way that allows us to create the experience of marQaha.\n \n\"In every chain of reasoning, the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that of the weakest link\nof the chain, whatever may be the strength of the rest.\"\n \nThomas Reid, circa 1786\n \n \n \nTrue To The Plant\n \n \nmarQaha has created whole plant extracted products since 2010, well before this was a globally preferred way to present cannabis as medicine. We recognized that, while this plant is medicinal it has also been used spiritually and recreationally for thousands of years. Given the spectrum of uses (sometimes many at the same time) we see the overall use as being therapeutic. \n \nmarQaha’s approach when creating a product is to combine, represent and elevate the most powerful components of each ingredient so they work in concert together. Terpenes are one of the more amazing elements that we choose to elevate. For example, our Blueberry Chamomile flasQ is designed to not only represent the whole cannabis plant but also elevates the whole plant profile and terpenes of the blueberry and chamomile plant.\n \nThere are 100's of potentially different compounds present in the plant, it's the interaction of these various compounds in cannabis that is known as the ‘entourage effect', here’s how it works. Cannabis contains 100's of chemical compounds. Researchers have identified over 60 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC,CBD and CBG. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant that also have regulatory effects. For example, terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. While THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in cannabis work together to produce this synergy of \"entourage\" effects. \n \nCannabis comes in thousands of different varieties, or strains. Different cannabis strains have vastly different chemical profiles that cause different experiences in the same person. This explains why sometimes cannabis can make a person feel calm, while other times it can make that same person feel anxious or paranoid. The chemical components of cannabis include, but are not limited to, terpenes, ketones, esters, lactones, alcohols, fatty acids, and steroids. The effects of all these chemicals working together and regulating each other will be much different than the effects of any one chemical working alone. Cannabis is made up of thousands of different chemicals that work together that creates a particular effect. Change the combination and you have a different effect, some of them are small while others are significant. This is the power of the plant and it's real potential!\n \n\"It's been proven by quite a few studies that plants are good for our psychological development. If you green an area, the rate of crime goes down. Torture victims begin to recover when they spend time outside in a garden with flowers.

California Dreamin’ infused drinks are delightfully flavored and consistently potent beverages --  the ideal way to enjoy cannabis. California Dreamin’ hand selects every flavor and hand bottles every drink in sunny California. Think of them as bottled, refreshing sunshine.\n\nMission:\nThe California Dreamin’ team started brewing delectable sparkling juices in early 2017 when the founders noticed that most of their friends were intimidated by the potency of current edible products on the market. The founders knew that while Southern California is incredibly lucky to be the epicenter of the best flower, concentrates, and edibles in the world, many patients wanted a lighter experience or simply had a low tolerance for cannabinoids. The team put their collective heads together, and decided to craft a cannabis-infused product that embodied everything about their beloved Golden State. Thus, California Dreamin’ was born, ready to refresh customers and offer delicious,  reliably dosed juices for its patients.\n\nProducts:\nCalifornia Dreamin’ delivers experiences that patients with any level of tolerance can enjoy. Sparkling juices are a fun, healthy, and refreshing way to enjoy cannabis without smoke or added sugar. To craft their beverages, California Dreamin’ beverage makers carefully blend cannabis tincture using their proprietary process, which guarantees accurate and consistent dosing. California Dreamin’s ingredients are all naturally sourced, and all its flavors are inspired by the bounty of California.  Whether it’s a sweet sparkling Tangerine drink or a tart, bubbly Pomegranate beverage, patients can rest assured that there are zero artificial ingredients, no added sugar, and no mysterious dosing.   \n\nLab Testing:\nQuality and consistency are California Dreamin’s top priorities. The team performs comprehensive testing through Pharmalabs on their extracts and beverages to guarantee potency and deliver safe, healthy drinks free of pesticides, microbes, and other unwanted agents.","informationWebsite":"http://www.drinkdreamin.com","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/gQU416fjRaK0jeVegplI_logo-medium.jpg","name":"California Dreamin'","tagline":"Share a dream with us"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"","cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/6q2Emj63QRYVYoaRvuks_caldreamin-cran-apple-031218.png","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":8,"name":"California Dreamin' Cranberry Apple 10mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-CA"],"photos":[{"id":24180,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/6q2Emj63QRYVYoaRvuks_caldreamin-cran-apple-031218.png","orderNumber":2}],"shortDescription":"Sparkling cranberry apple juice with 10mg infused THC per 11.2oz bottle","strain":{"slug":"j1","id":624,"aka":"J-1, j 1, Jack One, Jack 1","averageRating":null,"cannabinoidDataProducerCount":null,"cannabinoids":null,"category":"Hybrid","chemotype":null,"description":null,"descriptionPlain":null,"distanceMi":null,"effects":null,"energizeScore":null,"flowerImagePng":null,"flowerImageSvg":null,"name":"J1","nucleusImagePng":null,"nucleusImageSvg":null,"nugImage":null,"nugImageAltText":null,"phenotype":"Hybrid","populationRank":480,"reviewCount":null,"shortDescriptionPlain":null,"stockNugImage":null,"strainId":624,"subtitle":null,"symbol":null,"terpeneDataProducerCount":null,"terps":null,"topEffect":null,"topTerp":null},"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"","thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/6q2Emj63QRYVYoaRvuks_caldreamin-cran-apple-031218.png","videoUrl":null},{"id":229556,"slug":"natural-state-medicinals-sour-watermelon-bites-100mg-10-pack-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Arkansas"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":13528,"slug":"natural-state-medicinals","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Natural State Medicinals","tagline":null},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/39joOlvyR9qYr5COJQsP_NSM_WatermelonBites.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Sour Watermelon Bites 100mg 10-pack","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AR"],"photos":[{"id":160127,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/39joOlvyR9qYr5COJQsP_NSM_WatermelonBites.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"100","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":15499,"slug":"mad-hatter-coffee-and-tea-co-army-intelligence","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Nevada","Vermont","California","New Mexico","Arizona"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":4371,"slug":"mad-hatter-coffee-and-tea-co","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"THC and CBD infused Coffee, Tea, Mocha, Cocoa Mushroom Elixirs and Mocktails.

We support your personal journey by offering you this amazing plant embraced over thousands of years in a variety of ways. Medical, Spiritual or Therapeutic it offers so much and asks for so little in return. \n \n \nRespect\n \n \nTake it in and  Take Flight\n \nBring the plant in, Breathe and enjoy the new path that just opened up.\n \n \nMission\n \n \n \nmarQaha means bliss: We bring you closer to finding, achieving and maintaining the Plant's purpose in your life and the Bliss that comes through this relationship.\n \nIt is this union that is marQaha\n \nOne Planet many Plants: Cannabis offers something to everyone, we make it better by blending it with other power plants and ingredients so they work in concert together. Our speciality is the creation of different ingestible forms that harnesses the power of nature.\n \n \n \n“You are that vast thing that you see far, far off with great telescopes.”\n \nAlan Watts\n \n \nCraftsmanship\n \nHands on, small-batched perfection\n \n \nWe bring years of experience into each day. This is a delicate balance of hands-on production and verified lab results to confirm the consistency of each crafted batch. Repetition is the mother of perfection. Our processes are repeated hundreds of times a day and refined over years.  This is slow, deliberate perfection.\n \n \n“It's the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. And once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen.”\n \nMuhammad Ali\n \n \nThe sum of the parts\n \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link\n \n \nEach product we design requires so much more than cannabis to create something extraordinary. It's the union of all ingredients such as the coffee beans, chamomile tea and blueberries that brings harmony within the blend.\n \nSourced locally and globally, we are obsessed with finding the best ingredients and meeting the people behind them that grow the raw goods. Trust is established and friendships are fostered with the farmers, roasters and suppliers that makeup the finer pieces that create our products.  \n \nThis is the essence of our culture:  It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way that allows us to create the experience of marQaha.\n \n\"In every chain of reasoning, the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that of the weakest link\nof the chain, whatever may be the strength of the rest.\"\n \nThomas Reid, circa 1786\n \n \n \nTrue To The Plant\n \n \nmarQaha has created whole plant extracted products since 2010, well before this was a globally preferred way to present cannabis as medicine. We recognized that, while this plant is medicinal it has also been used spiritually and recreationally for thousands of years. Given the spectrum of uses (sometimes many at the same time) we see the overall use as being therapeutic. \n \nmarQaha’s approach when creating a product is to combine, represent and elevate the most powerful components of each ingredient so they work in concert together. Terpenes are one of the more amazing elements that we choose to elevate. For example, our Blueberry Chamomile flasQ is designed to not only represent the whole cannabis plant but also elevates the whole plant profile and terpenes of the blueberry and chamomile plant.\n \nThere are 100's of potentially different compounds present in the plant, it's the interaction of these various compounds in cannabis that is known as the ‘entourage effect', here’s how it works. Cannabis contains 100's of chemical compounds. Researchers have identified over 60 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC,CBD and CBG. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant that also have regulatory effects. For example, terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. While THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in cannabis work together to produce this synergy of \"entourage\" effects. \n \nCannabis comes in thousands of different varieties, or strains. Different cannabis strains have vastly different chemical profiles that cause different experiences in the same person. This explains why sometimes cannabis can make a person feel calm, while other times it can make that same person feel anxious or paranoid. The chemical components of cannabis include, but are not limited to, terpenes, ketones, esters, lactones, alcohols, fatty acids, and steroids. The effects of all these chemicals working together and regulating each other will be much different than the effects of any one chemical working alone. Cannabis is made up of thousands of different chemicals that work together that creates a particular effect. Change the combination and you have a different effect, some of them are small while others are significant. This is the power of the plant and it's real potential!\n \n\"It's been proven by quite a few studies that plants are good for our psychological development. If you green an area, the rate of crime goes down. Torture victims begin to recover when they spend time outside in a garden with flowers. So we need them, in some deep psychological sense, which I don't suppose anybody really understands yet.\"\n \nJane Goodall\n \n \nSo what does this word mean you ask?\n \n \nmarQaha is a very old Arabic word that refers to the “bliss” felt while drinking coffee, it has also come to mean “someone or something impossible to hate”. \n \n \n \nHistory and Beyond\n \nFounded in 2010, marQaha is one of the oldest and most trusted companies in the industry. Since this time we have heard many amazing stories, met amazing people and are still learning much about the plant. We are looking forward to continuing this journey together.","informationWebsite":"http://www.marqaha.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/KJfr5LyHS4Oi2GFqKIaW_6-Inch-marQaha-sticker.png","name":"marQaha","tagline":"Take Flight"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"Fast Acting, Discreet and Portable!\n\nWe took our 10 years in the industry and leveraged our knowledge of creating powder based beverages (one of our founders created a powder based effervescent beverage company in 2006) to bring you sprinQ !!\n\nSimply sprinkle into your favorite beverage or food to achieve a state of Bliss whenever life needs a rest! sprinQ comes in three mico-dose versions to the meet the challenge:\n\n\n\nTUNE: 5 MG of THC (20 stickpacks per bag)\nEQUALIZE: 5 MG of THC / 5 MG CBD (20 stickpacks per bag)\nPOWER: 10 MG CBD /  1 MG THC (10 stickpacks per bag)\n\nProduct Highlights:\nA)           Ethically Grown and Environmentally Sourced*\nB)           Water soluble \nC)           Sugar Free\nD)           Gluten Free\nE)            Vegan\n\n\nPowered by plantrica:\n\nA) nanoTeQ: Nano-Particle technology means quicker absorption times and consistent formula effects\nB) eQuiLib: THC Anti-Anxiety formulation \n \n* All marQaha ingredients are deeply researched where we have verified the ethics of origin and analysis.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/OjUytV4SQIaKeIAuHJeo_sprinQ-TUNE-stickpack-Overview.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":22,"name":"sprinQ TUNE THC (Dissolvable Cannabis Powder)","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-CO"],"photos":[{"id":85434,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/OjUytV4SQIaKeIAuHJeo_sprinQ-TUNE-stickpack-Overview.png","orderNumber":6},{"id":85446,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/MMACvBhmTaaGEfLyxaQK_Elevations-Vertical.png","orderNumber":7},{"id":85447,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/tShOTjB4TumEqImMTE29_sprinQ-descriptive.png","orderNumber":9},{"id":85448,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/Q0MTHL3QTCWXZfGtEOVP_Powered-by-plantrica-for-LeafLink.png","orderNumber":10},{"id":85449,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/Vu7MBNlQQfWRCP4H75Hy_Ethics-for-Leaflink.png","orderNumber":11}],"shortDescription":"sprinQ TUNE THC (Dissolvable Cannabis Powder) Fast Acting, Discreet and Portable !","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/OjUytV4SQIaKeIAuHJeo_sprinQ-TUNE-stickpack-Overview.png","videoUrl":null},{"id":35195,"slug":"a2fly-orange-cream-cbd-hemp-soda","affiliateLinkText":"Buy Here","affiliateLinkUrl":"https://shopa2fly.com/collections/cbd-products-shopa2fly-com/products/orange-cream-hemp-soda","availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":[],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":6562,"slug":"a2fly","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"✈A2FLY SHOPA2FLY.COM is a Health and Wellness Brand.

Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":null,"hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.imgix.net/shared-web-images/product-type-icons/menu_edibles.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Elixir (Honey) Sativa","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[],"shortDescription":null,"strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":78596,"slug":"harmony-farms-legal-tonic-lemon-ginger-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":4957,"slug":"harmony-farms","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"As both company and people we promote a future filled with harmony.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The

We support your personal journey by offering you this amazing plant embraced over thousands of years in a variety of ways. Medical, Spiritual or Therapeutic it offers so much and asks for so little in return. \n \n \nRespect\n \n \nTake it in and  Take Flight\n \nBring the plant in, Breathe and enjoy the new path that just opened up.\n \n \nMission\n \n \n \nmarQaha means bliss: We bring you closer to finding, achieving and maintaining the Plant's purpose in your life and the Bliss that comes through this relationship.\n \nIt is this union that is marQaha\n \nOne Planet many Plants: Cannabis offers something to everyone, we make it better by blending it with other power plants and ingredients so they work in concert together. Our speciality is the creation of different ingestible forms that harnesses the power of nature.\n \n \n \n“You are that vast thing that you see far, far off with great telescopes.”\n \nAlan Watts\n \n \nCraftsmanship\n \nHands on, small-batched perfection\n \n \nWe bring years of experience into each day. This is a delicate balance of hands-on production and verified lab results to confirm the consistency of each crafted batch. Repetition is the mother of perfection. Our processes are repeated hundreds of times a day and refined over years.  This is slow, deliberate perfection.\n \n \n“It's the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. And once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen.”\n \nMuhammad Ali\n \n \nThe sum of the parts\n \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link\n \n \nEach product we design requires so much more than cannabis to create something extraordinary. It's the union of all ingredients such as the coffee beans, chamomile tea and blueberries that brings harmony within the blend.\n \nSourced locally and globally, we are obsessed with finding the best ingredients and meeting the people behind them that grow the raw goods. Trust is established and friendships are fostered with the farmers, roasters and suppliers that makeup the finer pieces that create our products.  \n \nThis is the essence of our culture:  It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way that allows us to create the experience of marQaha.\n \n\"In every chain of reasoning, the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that of the weakest link\nof the chain, whatever may be the strength of the rest.\"\n \nThomas Reid, circa 1786\n \n \n \nTrue To The Plant\n \n \nmarQaha has created whole plant extracted products since 2010, well before this was a globally preferred way to present cannabis as medicine. We recognized that, while this plant is medicinal it has also been used spiritually and recreationally for thousands of years. Given the spectrum of uses (sometimes many at the same time) we see the overall use as being therapeutic. \n \nmarQaha’s approach when creating a product is to combine, represent and elevate the most powerful components of each ingredient so they work in concert together. Terpenes are one of the more amazing elements that we choose to elevate. For example, our Blueberry Chamomile flasQ is designed to not only represent the whole cannabis plant but also elevates the whole plant profile and terpenes of the blueberry and chamomile plant.\n \nThere are 100's of potentially different compounds present in the plant, it's the interaction of these various compounds in cannabis that is known as the ‘entourage effect', here’s how it works. Cannabis contains 100's of chemical compounds. Researchers have identified over 60 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC,CBD and CBG. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant that also have regulatory effects. For example, terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. While THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in cannabis work together to produce this synergy of \"entourage\" effects. \n \nCannabis comes in thousands of different varieties, or strains. Different cannabis strains have vastly different chemical profiles that cause different experiences in the same person. This explains why sometimes cannabis can make a person feel calm, while other times it can make that same person feel anxious or paranoid. The chemical components of cannabis include, but are not limited to, terpenes, ketones, esters, lactones, alcohols, fatty acids, and steroids. The effects of all these chemicals working together and regulating each other will be much different than the effects of any one chemical working alone. Cannabis is made up of thousands of different chemicals that work together that creates a particular effect. Change the combination and you have a different effect, some of them are small while others are significant. This is the power of the plant and it's real potential!\n \n\"It's been proven by quite a few studies that plants are good for our psychological development. If you green an area, the rate of crime goes down. Torture victims begin to recover when they spend time outside in a garden with flowers. So we need them, in some deep psychological sense, which I don't suppose anybody really understands yet.\"\n \nJane Goodall\n \n \nSo what does this word mean you ask?\n \n \nmarQaha is a very old Arabic word that refers to the “bliss” felt while drinking coffee, it has also come to mean “someone or something impossible to hate”. \n \n \n \nHistory and Beyond\n \nFounded in 2010, marQaha is one of the oldest and most trusted companies in the industry. Since this time we have heard many amazing stories, met amazing people and are still learning much about the plant. We are looking forward to continuing this journey together.","informationWebsite":"http://www.marqaha.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/KJfr5LyHS4Oi2GFqKIaW_6-Inch-marQaha-sticker.png","name":"marQaha","tagline":"Take Flight"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"We gave a nod to the great peaches grown in Colorado (Hello Palisade!) to create our latest flavor, the Indica based Sweet Peach Tea!

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products.

Mountain High Suckers has produced handmade suckers and lozenges since their beginning in 2009. Not afraid to be bold, we infuse spiciness, mango and even coconut into treats, too. We’re the pioneer in the CBD market, providing edibles that have less of a psychoactive effect and yet still provide a host of benefits, with anti-cancer properties being aggressively researched—many call CBD the “future of MMJ.” Most patients will be able to get several doses from a single sucker or lozenge pack. Chad Tribble and John Garrison started the company back in 2009. Within months they began testing their strains and discovered their genetics provided a fair amount of CBD. Since then we’ve tested every batch of our hash oil to ensure proper potency and consistency within our products. We’ve continued at a steady pace, cultivating the same genetics and hand making our products the same way today as we did in the beginning.","informationWebsite":"http://www.mountainhighsuckers.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/yGUE4He3Q6ieQnomM1O1_mhs-tagline.png","name":"Mountain High Suckers","tagline":"THC + CBD Infused Hard Candy Edibles"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"10","cbdContentType":"mg","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/D8KBSPFISt6LUMk6Nsi5_Mountain-High-Suckers-Logo.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Strawberry Sucker 10mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-CO"],"photos":[{"id":129442,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/D8KBSPFISt6LUMk6Nsi5_Mountain-High-Suckers-Logo.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"30","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":207470,"slug":"olala-mortimers-cream-soda-100mg-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":3143,"slug":"olala","availableCountries":["Canada","United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Yummy cannabis-infused sodas in 10 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg varietals, along with Co2-extracted, terpene-rich concentrates from the best farms in the state!

All of our products are made in-house using a proprietary extraction process that is completely free of any non-medicinal plant constituents and high-quality organic ingredients. Our products are Vegan and GMO Free.\r\n\r\nEach batch of essential cannabis oil produced is tested both on and offsite to ensure that every dose our customers ingest is pure and safe, and delivers the same level of relief every time. From hard candies, suckers and capsules to oral sprays and tinctures, our confections are known for their delicious flavors, long-lasting effects and minimal cannabis flavor.\r\n\r\nAt Canyon Cultivation, we take extreme pride in the high-quality, infused products we create. However, we did not want to create products that just taste good. We wanted to raise the bar and develop something that no other manufacturer is currently producing . We wanted to introduce a line of boutique products that were completely free of synthetic ingredients or petroleum distillates, such as butane or propane.\r\n\r\nWe use only co2 to extract our cannabis essential oil from organic plant materials, making it entirely safe for consumption. \r\n\r\nIn addition to our unique cannabis oil, Canyon Cultivation’s edibles are made with all-natural or organic ingredients that are sourced locally whenever possible.\r\n\r\nCanyon Cultivation was developed by two generations of idealists living in the mountain canyons of Colorado. And like many innovators before us, our business began in the small confines of my parent’s basement with nothing more than passion, determination and vision.\r\n\r\nOur mission was two-fold: To develop a line of wholesome cannabis-infused products that were flavorful, discreet, and accurately medicated, as well as become pioneers in Ethanol based concentrates. This was no small feat, but after much adversity we succeeded and our unique line of edibles made their official debut in 2011.\r\n\r\nIn just a few short years, we have grown to be one of the leading manufacturers of infused edibles in Colorado and we have no intention of stopping there. We have several new and exciting ventures on the horizon and we look forward to sharing this journey with you.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"","cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.imgix.net/shared-web-images/product-type-icons/menu_edibles.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Honey Elixir Indica 100mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"","thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":241611,"slug":"just-society-honey-green-tea-5mg-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Nevada"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":14231,"slug":"just-society","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Just Society","tagline":null},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"This ain’t your gradma’s tea party.

Evidence suggests that the cacao tree was cultivated by those early cultures, and that ground cacao beans were mixed into a chocolate drink. Its bitter flavor was masked by native herbs and spices until the addition of sugar, which was introduced by the Europeans.\n\nWe use our proprietary organic spice blend of Cinnamon, Nutmeg, and Cayenne Pepper in combination with that Peruvian Chocolate we referenced previously. And, out of respect for both health and history, we don’t use traditional sugar. Xylitol is a naturally-derived sugar that is low-calorie, has a low glycolic index, and kills the bacteria in your mouth that causes tooth decay as well as other systemic diseases. All this is steeped and brewed together to create a chocolate -based drink that you have to taste to believe!","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/iLoO9C6SQ8GcQN2Eqjgr_TherapyAnytimeMocha2oz50mg.png","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Therapy's Anytime Cayenne Mexican Mocha •  2oz | 50mg THC","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-CA"],"photos":[{"id":97893,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/iLoO9C6SQ8GcQN2Eqjgr_TherapyAnytimeMocha2oz50mg.png","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"Vegan.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/m0H6d5ZZQrCcfJvWXdlm_leafly honey.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Sativa Honey Elixir 100mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[{"id":119581,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/m0H6d5ZZQrCcfJvWXdlm_leafly honey.png","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"0","thcContentType":"none","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":86411,"slug":"olala-lemon-lime-250mg-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":3143,"slug":"olala","availableCountries":["Canada","United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Yummy cannabis-infused sodas in 10 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg varietals, along with Co2-extracted, terpene-rich concentrates from the best farms in the state!

The effects of all these chemicals working together and regulating each other will be much different than the effects of any one chemical working alone.

We recognized that, while this plant is medicinal it has also been used spiritually and recreationally for thousands of years. Given the spectrum of uses (sometimes many at the same time) we see the overall use as being therapeutic. \n \nmarQaha’s approach when creating a product is to combine, represent and elevate the most powerful components of each ingredient so they work in concert together. Terpenes are one of the more amazing elements that we choose to elevate. For example, our Blueberry Chamomile flasQ is designed to not only represent the whole cannabis plant but also elevates the whole plant profile and terpenes of the blueberry and chamomile plant.\n \nThere are 100's of potentially different compounds present in the plant, it's the interaction of these various compounds in cannabis that is known as the ‘entourage effect', here’s how it works. Cannabis contains 100's of chemical compounds. Researchers have identified over 60 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC,CBD and CBG. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant that also have regulatory effects. For example, terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. While THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in cannabis work together to produce this synergy of \"entourage\" effects. \n \nCannabis comes in thousands of different varieties, or strains. Different cannabis strains have vastly different chemical profiles that cause different experiences in the same person. This explains why sometimes cannabis can make a person feel calm, while other times it can make that same person feel anxious or paranoid. The chemical components of cannabis include, but are not limited to, terpenes, ketones, esters, lactones, alcohols, fatty acids, and steroids. The effects of all these chemicals working together and regulating each other will be much different than the effects of any one chemical working alone. Cannabis is made up of thousands of different chemicals that work together that creates a particular effect. Change the combination and you have a different effect, some of them are small while others are significant. This is the power of the plant and it's real potential!\n \n\"It's been proven by quite a few studies that plants are good for our psychological development. If you green an area, the rate of crime goes down. Torture victims begin to recover when they spend time outside in a garden with flowers. So we need them, in some deep psychological sense, which I don't suppose anybody really understands yet.\"\n \nJane Goodall\n \n \nSo what does this word mean you ask?\n \n \nmarQaha is a very old Arabic word that refers to the “bliss” felt while drinking coffee, it has also come to mean “someone or something impossible to hate”. \n \n \n \nHistory and Beyond\n \nFounded in 2010, marQaha is one of the oldest and most trusted companies in the industry. Since this time we have heard many amazing stories, met amazing people and are still learning much about the plant.

We support your personal journey by offering you this amazing plant embraced over thousands of years in a variety of ways. Medical, Spiritual or Therapeutic it offers so much and asks for so little in return. \n \n \nRespect\n \n \nTake it in and  Take Flight\n \nBring the plant in, Breathe and enjoy the new path that just opened up.\n \n \nMission\n \n \n \nmarQaha means bliss: We bring you closer to finding, achieving and maintaining the Plant's purpose in your life and the Bliss that comes through this relationship.\n \nIt is this union that is marQaha\n \nOne Planet many Plants: Cannabis offers something to everyone, we make it better by blending it with other power plants and ingredients so they work in concert together. Our speciality is the creation of different ingestible forms that harnesses the power of nature.\n \n \n \n“You are that vast thing that you see far, far off with great telescopes.”\n \nAlan Watts\n \n \nCraftsmanship\n \nHands on, small-batched perfection\n \n \nWe bring years of experience into each day. This is a delicate balance of hands-on production and verified lab results to confirm the consistency of each crafted batch. Repetition is the mother of perfection. Our processes are repeated hundreds of times a day and refined over years.  This is slow, deliberate perfection.\n \n \n“It's the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. And once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen.”\n \nMuhammad Ali\n \n \nThe sum of the parts\n \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link\n \n \nEach product we design requires so much more than cannabis to create something extraordinary. It's the union of all ingredients such as the coffee beans, chamomile tea and blueberries that brings harmony within the blend.\n \nSourced locally and globally, we are obsessed with finding the best ingredients and meeting the people behind them that grow the raw goods. Trust is established and friendships are fostered with the farmers, roasters and suppliers that makeup the finer pieces that create our products.  \n \nThis is the essence of our culture:  It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way that allows us to create the experience of marQaha.\n \n\"In every chain of reasoning, the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that of the weakest link\nof the chain, whatever may be the strength of the rest.\"\n \nThomas Reid, circa 1786\n \n \n \nTrue To The Plant\n \n \nmarQaha has created whole plant extracted products since 2010, well before this was a globally preferred way to present cannabis as medicine. We recognized that, while this plant is medicinal it has also been used spiritually and recreationally for thousands of years. Given the spectrum of uses (sometimes many at the same time) we see the overall use as being therapeutic. \n \nmarQaha’s approach when creating a product is to combine, represent and elevate the most powerful components of each ingredient so they work in concert together. Terpenes are one of the more amazing elements that we choose to elevate. For example, our Blueberry Chamomile flasQ is designed to not only represent the whole cannabis plant but also elevates the whole plant profile and terpenes of the blueberry and chamomile plant.\n \nThere are 100's of potentially different compounds present in the plant, it's the interaction of these various compounds in cannabis that is known as the ‘entourage effect', here’s how it works. Cannabis contains 100's of chemical compounds. Researchers have identified over 60 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC,CBD and CBG. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant that also have regulatory effects. For example, terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own.

What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/aiHAmWpKR2WfJmnxBCvD_BLUEBERRY LEMONADE.PNG","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Sativa Blueberry Ginger Lemonade 25mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[{"id":155263,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/aiHAmWpKR2WfJmnxBCvD_BLUEBERRY LEMONADE.PNG","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Beverages","subcategorySlug":"beverages","thcContent":"25","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":210681,"slug":"temescal-wellness-orange-drink-mix-40mg-beverages","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["New Hampshire"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":10856,"slug":"temescal-wellness","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Temescal Wellness provides qualifying patients with a variety of high-quality cannabis products and education, in strict compliance with state and local rules and regulations.\n\nDispensaries:\nTemescal Wellness - Hudson | Medical & Recreational Cannabis\n252 Coolidge St.\nHudson, MA 01749\n978-212-5947\n\nTemescal Wellness - Framingham | Medical Cannabis\n665 Cochituate Rd.
