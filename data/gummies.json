This captivating form of flora has been cultivated in communities around the world for thousands of years to help enhance our natural states of being. Over time, however, a number of misnomers have persisted - so we decided to go back to its roots. Look closely at any cannabis plant and you’ll find miniature specks called trichomes, which produce the cannabinoids THC and CBD that give the plant its widely-sought effects. Each plant has a unique profile of accessory cannabinoids, however, the exact effects of these are being studied by our esteemed group of scientists. What we do know is that even after you extract the full spectrum of cannabinoids from the plant, the ratio of THC to CBD has far and away the largest impact on the effects we feel.\n\nPLUS has been a consistent leader in low-dose edibles. You can always take more, but you can’t take less. The ability to adjust your intake and tailor the magnitude of the effects allows even the most experienced cannabis consumers to find their just right. The world moves fast, and so do we.

Edible products are not a one size fits all solution, which is why Copia is proud to offer a wide range of products for all demographics and preferences.\n\nCopia is proud to announce a new partnership with K.I.N.D Concentrates, Keef Cola & Tommy Chongs.

We support your personal journey by offering you this amazing plant embraced over thousands of years in a variety of ways. Medical, Spiritual or Therapeutic it offers so much and asks for so little in return. \n \n \nRespect\n \n \nTake it in and  Take Flight\n \nBring the plant in, Breathe and enjoy the new path that just opened up.\n \n \nMission\n \n \n \nmarQaha means bliss: We bring you closer to finding, achieving and maintaining the Plant's purpose in your life and the Bliss that comes through this relationship.\n \nIt is this union that is marQaha\n \nOne Planet many Plants: Cannabis offers something to everyone, we make it better by blending it with other power plants and ingredients so they work in concert together. Our speciality is the creation of different ingestible forms that harnesses the power of nature.\n \n \n \n“You are that vast thing that you see far, far off with great telescopes.”\n \nAlan Watts\n \n \nCraftsmanship\n \nHands on, small-batched perfection\n \n \nWe bring years of experience into each day. This is a delicate balance of hands-on production and verified lab results to confirm the consistency of each crafted batch. Repetition is the mother of perfection. Our processes are repeated hundreds of times a day and refined over years.  This is slow, deliberate perfection.\n \n \n“It's the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. And once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen.”\n \nMuhammad Ali\n \n \nThe sum of the parts\n \nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link\n \n \nEach product we design requires so much more than cannabis to create something extraordinary. It's the union of all ingredients such as the coffee beans, chamomile tea and blueberries that brings harmony within the blend.\n \nSourced locally and globally, we are obsessed with finding the best ingredients and meeting the people behind them that grow the raw goods. Trust is established and friendships are fostered with the farmers, roasters and suppliers that makeup the finer pieces that create our products.  \n \nThis is the essence of our culture:  It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way that allows us to create the experience of marQaha.\n \n\"In every chain of reasoning, the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that of the weakest link\nof the chain, whatever may be the strength of the rest.\"\n \nThomas Reid, circa 1786\n \n \n \nTrue To The Plant\n \n \nmarQaha has created whole plant extracted products since 2010, well before this was a globally preferred way to present cannabis as medicine. We recognized that, while this plant is medicinal it has also been used spiritually and recreationally for thousands of years. Given the spectrum of uses (sometimes many at the same time) we see the overall use as being therapeutic. \n \nmarQaha’s approach when creating a product is to combine, represent and elevate the most powerful components of each ingredient so they work in concert together. Terpenes are one of the more amazing elements that we choose to elevate. For example, our Blueberry Chamomile flasQ is designed to not only represent the whole cannabis plant but also elevates the whole plant profile and terpenes of the blueberry and chamomile plant.\n \nThere are 100's of potentially different compounds present in the plant, it's the interaction of these various compounds in cannabis that is known as the ‘entourage effect', here’s how it works. Cannabis contains 100's of chemical compounds. Researchers have identified over 60 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC,CBD and CBG. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant that also have regulatory effects. For example, terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. While THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in cannabis work together to produce this synergy of \"entourage\" effects. \n \nCannabis comes in thousands of different varieties, or strains. Different cannabis strains have vastly different chemical profiles that cause different experiences in the same person. This explains why sometimes cannabis can make a person feel calm, while other times it can make that same person feel anxious or paranoid. The chemical components of cannabis include, but are not limited to, terpenes, ketones, esters, lactones, alcohols, fatty acids, and steroids. The effects of all these chemicals working together and regulating each other will be much different than the effects of any one chemical working alone. Cannabis is made up of thousands of different chemicals that work together that creates a particular effect. Change the combination and you have a different effect, some of them are small while others are significant. This is the power of the plant and it's real potential!\n \n\"It's been proven by quite a few studies that plants are good for our psychological development. If you green an area, the rate of crime goes down. Torture victims begin to recover when they spend time outside in a garden with flowers. So we need them, in some deep psychological sense, which I don't suppose anybody really understands yet.\"\n \nJane Goodall\n \n \nSo what does this word mean you ask?\n \n \nmarQaha is a very old Arabic word that refers to the “bliss” felt while drinking coffee, it has also come to mean “someone or something impossible to hate”. \n \n \n \nHistory and Beyond\n \nFounded in 2010, marQaha is one of the oldest and most trusted companies in the industry. Since this time we have heard many amazing stories, met amazing people and are still learning much about the plant. We are looking forward to continuing this journey together.","informationWebsite":"http://www.marqaha.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/KJfr5LyHS4Oi2GFqKIaW_6-Inch-marQaha-sticker.png","name":"marQaha","tagline":"Take Flight"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"Blueberry Chamomile - Indica Fruit Punch - Sativa 10 Gummies for 10 MG a piece Gluten Free, Vegan, and Pectin Based","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/tSWBcCLVSxaIqOAprzVX_230828_DayNightGummy_rendering.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Mixed Flavor GoGo Gummies 100mg 10-pack","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-CO"],"photos":[{"id":138147,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/tSWBcCLVSxaIqOAprzVX_230828_DayNightGummy_rendering.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":null,"strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Gummies","subcategorySlug":"gummies","thcContent":"100","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":225385,"slug":"incredibles-red-drops-gummies-100mg-20-pack-candy","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Massachusetts"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":4880,"slug":"incredibles","availableCountries":["Canada","United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Our story began with “special cookies” to help ease Grandma Noni’s pain.

This captivating form of flora has been cultivated in communities around the world for thousands of years to help enhance our natural states of being. Over time, however, a number of misnomers have persisted - so we decided to go back to its roots. Look closely at any cannabis plant and you’ll find miniature specks called trichomes, which produce the cannabinoids THC and CBD that give the plant its widely-sought effects. Each plant has a unique profile of accessory cannabinoids, however, the exact effects of these are being studied by our esteemed group of scientists. What we do know is that even after you extract the full spectrum of cannabinoids from the plant, the ratio of THC to CBD has far and away the largest impact on the effects we feel.\n\nPLUS has been a consistent leader in low-dose edibles. You can always take more, but you can’t take less. The ability to adjust your intake and tailor the magnitude of the effects allows even the most experienced cannabis consumers to find their just right. The world moves fast, and so do we.

This captivating form of flora has been cultivated in communities around the world for thousands of years to help enhance our natural states of being. Over time, however, a number of misnomers have persisted - so we decided to go back to its roots. Look closely at any cannabis plant and you’ll find miniature specks called trichomes, which produce the cannabinoids THC and CBD that give the plant its widely-sought effects. Each plant has a unique profile of accessory cannabinoids, however, the exact effects of these are being studied by our esteemed group of scientists. What we do know is that even after you extract the full spectrum of cannabinoids from the plant, the ratio of THC to CBD has far and away the largest impact on the effects we feel.\n\nPLUS has been a consistent leader in low-dose edibles. You can always take more, but you can’t take less. The ability to adjust your intake and tailor the magnitude of the effects allows even the most experienced cannabis consumers to find their just right. The world moves fast, and so do we.

This captivating form of flora has been cultivated in communities around the world for thousands of years to help enhance our natural states of being. Over time, however, a number of misnomers have persisted - so we decided to go back to its roots. Look closely at any cannabis plant and you’ll find miniature specks called trichomes, which produce the cannabinoids THC and CBD that give the plant its widely-sought effects. Each plant has a unique profile of accessory cannabinoids, however, the exact effects of these are being studied by our esteemed group of scientists. What we do know is that even after you extract the full spectrum of cannabinoids from the plant, the ratio of THC to CBD has far and away the largest impact on the effects we feel.\n\nPLUS has been a consistent leader in low-dose edibles. You can always take more, but you can’t take less. The ability to adjust your intake and tailor the magnitude of the effects allows even the most experienced cannabis consumers to find their just right. The world moves fast, and so do we. As new technologies and techniques advance, PLUS will continue to be at the forefront of real cannabis science.","informationWebsite":"https://plusproducts.com","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":true,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/WahuQIPpQrWmGdJoKCgc_PLUS_balance_logo.png","name":"PLUS Products","tagline":"Find Your Just Right"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"Celebrate Pride with PLUS!

We were one of the first companies to pioneer the trails of the industry. Chronic Candy started because we wanted to find a way to get the medicinal benefits without getting high, our answer was CBD. Our original hemp candy was popular amidst the cannabis culture, as we were the first product to have a taste & effect similar to “chronic”. We started out traveling to festivals & events, stopping by smoke shops along the way. During the first several years we had to drive across the country to get the word out about our new product. We had a delivery van wrapped with custom graphics, our logo surrounded by a bunch of luscious cannabis plants. Keep in mind that we’re driving this van around the country in the late 90’s / early 2000’s before the wave of legalization. The main ingredient in our product is hemp derived CBD, which makes them perfectly legal. Due to the nature of our company it was still nerve-racking driving across the highly regulated states. Regardless, we still managed to tour across the country several times & create a known presence at hundreds of festivals & events. CBD has been the key ingredient in Chronic Candy since the beginning. Originally we used CBD derived from hempseed oil, potency ranged from 30-40% which allowed us to create low dose CBD edibles. The lollipop was the original Chronic Candy, a small 10mg lollipop that tasted of “chronic” – we’ve also done sodas, ice-cream, topicals & much more.\n \nThe legalization of the cannabis & hemp industries has allowed for innovation in CBD extraction to advance dramatically. Pure CBD isolation is now possible through advanced methods of distillation. We’ve teamed up with Isodiol to supply us with the highest quality 99.9% CBD available on the market. This method of extraction creates a pure CBD product with almost 100% potency.\n \nUsing 99.9% CBD isolate we’re able to infuse our products with higher doses to meet the various needs of people across the country. We’ve also introduced an entire new line of products ; beverages, edibles, pet care & topicals. All of our products are made with 99.9% CBD isolate, a naturally derived product from hemp.","informationWebsite":"http://chroniccandy.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/w22bzZPWQEqWbmQsuCjX_chronic%20candy.jpg","name":"Chronic Candy","tagline":"CBD infused products made with quality ingredients"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"250","cbdContentType":"mg","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":null,"hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/NROArRFqSCsiH6kNmd5Q_Sour Worm gummies.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Sour Worms CBD Gummies 250mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-OK"],"photos":[{"id":163408,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/NROArRFqSCsiH6kNmd5Q_Sour Worm gummies.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":null,"strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Gummies","subcategorySlug":"gummies","thcContent":"0","thcContentType":"none","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":245547,"slug":"choice-labs-assorted-flavors-gummies-chews-100mg-10-pack-candy","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Michigan"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":14336,"slug":"choice-labs","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Choice Labs","tagline":null},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":null,"hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/W3ysNVwoRLeY8WV3wY3u_chews_Kb4epnh.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Assorted Flavors Gummies Chews 100mg 10-pack","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-MI"],"photos":[{"id":174851,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/W3ysNVwoRLeY8WV3wY3u_chews_Kb4epnh.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":null,"strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Gummies","subcategorySlug":"gummies","thcContent":"100","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":246728,"slug":"copia-tropical-gummies-300mg-10-pack-candy","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Arizona"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":11561,"slug":"ogeez","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Copia is Arizona’s first original scratch-made cannabis kitchen and has been dedicated to making all products fresh from scratch.

We pioneered CBD to THC ratios that deliver powerful relief.  Our tinctures, soft gels, vapes, edibles and topicals are made with cannabis oil safely extracted from sungrown, high CBD cannabis varieties. Our full spectrum CBD oil is rich in phytocannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpenes, and all of our products are triple tested for consistent, precise dosing you can trust. In recent years, we've researched and innovated to offer cannabis wellness with unparalleled efficacy.  Our newly formulated ratio line goes beyond CBD and THC, harnessing the full therapeutic potential of the cannabis plant. We have reformulated our tinctures and soft gels to be more potent and effective than ever before. We've increased our cannabinoid count by at least 25% per ratio and added the minor but mighty cannabinoids, CBDa and THCa.

Lab tested to perfection, our CBD ensures only the best quality CBD is used in our products. Benefits of CBD include help with stress, inflammation, anxiety, depression, nausea, and even insomnia.\n\nNew users commonly wonder how many CBD gummies they should take to avoid taking too much. The answer is simple, you can take as much as you want without any harmful side effects! We recommend taking one or two gummy bears to start. The affects should become noticeable in about 45 minutes to an hour.\n\nPeople suffering from any type of arthritis-related pains, like lower back or knee pain should notice a reduction in the pain or inflammation. Topical creams that contain CBD can also be used to spot treat certain areas with high inflammation.\n\nFor treatment of anxiety or stress, CBD will start to ease levels within an hour of taking CBD. If you notice that you’re still experiencing stress and anxiety, you can increase the dosage to 3 to 4 gummy bears to increase the affects.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, if you weigh more, you may need to take more. This holds true with any supplements, the larger you are the more you will need to get the desired effects. Continue to try different dosage amounts each time you decide to use CBD and find the right dosage amount that works for you.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/XtFjr4wQSn2X7ZwF0VEJ_500mggummies.png","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":25,"name":"Hemptrance CBD Gummies 500mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US"],"photos":[{"id":91826,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/XtFjr4wQSn2X7ZwF0VEJ_500mggummies.png","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"Hemptrance CBD Gummies 500mg","strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Gummies","subcategorySlug":"gummies","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/XtFjr4wQSn2X7ZwF0VEJ_500mggummies.png","videoUrl":null},{"id":185687,"slug":"ieso-sour-watermelon-gummies-25mg-5pk-candy","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Illinois"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":13371,"slug":"ieso","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"IESO","tagline":null},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":null,"hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/RlqpNdMyQDCN3M55YfEN_IESO Logo.jpeg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Sour Watermelon Gummies 25mg 5-pack","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-IL"],"photos":[{"id":132474,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/RlqpNdMyQDCN3M55YfEN_IESO Logo.jpeg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":null,"strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Gummies","subcategorySlug":"gummies","thcContent":"25","thcContentType":"mg","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":200762,"slug":"hush-canna-pineapple-passion-gummy-50mg-candy","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Oregon"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":5238,"slug":"hush-canna","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"We believe quality of life is better when there is wide diversity at any and every level of existence.

We were one of the first companies to pioneer the trails of the industry. Chronic Candy started because we wanted to find a way to get the medicinal benefits without getting high, our answer was CBD. Our original hemp candy was popular amidst the cannabis culture, as we were the first product to have a taste & effect similar to “chronic”. We started out traveling to festivals & events, stopping by smoke shops along the way. During the first several years we had to drive across the country to get the word out about our new product. We had a delivery van wrapped with custom graphics, our logo surrounded by a bunch of luscious cannabis plants. Keep in mind that we’re driving this van around the country in the late 90’s / early 2000’s before the wave of legalization. The main ingredient in our product is hemp derived CBD, which makes them perfectly legal. Due to the nature of our company it was still nerve-racking driving across the highly regulated states. Regardless, we still managed to tour across the country several times & create a known presence at hundreds of festivals & events. CBD has been the key ingredient in Chronic Candy since the beginning. Originally we used CBD derived from hempseed oil, potency ranged from 30-40% which allowed us to create low dose CBD edibles. The lollipop was the original Chronic Candy, a small 10mg lollipop that tasted of “chronic” – we’ve also done sodas, ice-cream, topicals & much more.\n \nThe legalization of the cannabis & hemp industries has allowed for innovation in CBD extraction to advance dramatically. Pure CBD isolation is now possible through advanced methods of distillation. We’ve teamed up with Isodiol to supply us with the highest quality 99.9% CBD available on the market. This method of extraction creates a pure CBD product with almost 100% potency.\n \nUsing 99.9% CBD isolate we’re able to infuse our products with higher doses to meet the various needs of people across the country. We’ve also introduced an entire new line of products ; beverages, edibles, pet care & topicals. All of our products are made with 99.9% CBD isolate, a naturally derived product from hemp.","informationWebsite":"http://chroniccandy.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/w22bzZPWQEqWbmQsuCjX_chronic%20candy.jpg","name":"Chronic Candy","tagline":"CBD infused products made with quality ingredients"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":"250","cbdContentType":"mg","countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":null,"hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/NROArRFqSCsiH6kNmd5Q_Sour Worm gummies.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Sour Worms CBD Gummies 250mg","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-OK"],"photos":[{"id":163408,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/NROArRFqSCsiH6kNmd5Q_Sour Worm gummies.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":null,"strain":null,"subcategoryName":"Gummies","subcategorySlug":"gummies","thcContent":"0","thcContentType":"none","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":310697,"slug":"chemistry-blueberry-hibiscus-gummies-candy","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":"https://www.trychemistry.com/product-page/blueberry-hibiscus","availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["California"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":0,"bestOfferVariant":null,"brand":{"id":12751,"slug":"chemistry","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Chemistry's single cultivar, full-spectrum cannabis products are made using small batches of whole flower lovingly grown under the sun by some of Northern California's best (and brightest) craft cultivators.

This captivating form of flora has been cultivated in communities around the world for thousands of years to help enhance our natural states of being. Over time, however, a number of misnomers have persisted - so we decided to go back to its roots. Look closely at any cannabis plant and you’ll find miniature specks called trichomes, which produce the cannabinoids THC and CBD that give the plant its widely-sought effects. Each plant has a unique profile of accessory cannabinoids, however, the exact effects of these are being studied by our esteemed group of scientists. What we do know is that even after you extract the full spectrum of cannabinoids from the plant, the ratio of THC to CBD has far and away the largest impact on the effects we feel.\n\nPLUS has been a consistent leader in low-dose edibles. You can always take more, but you can’t take less.

This captivating form of flora has been cultivated in communities around the world for thousands of years to help enhance our natural states of being. Over time, however, a number of misnomers have persisted - so we decided to go back to its roots. Look closely at any cannabis plant and you’ll find miniature specks called trichomes, which produce the cannabinoids THC and CBD that give the plant its widely-sought effects. Each plant has a unique profile of accessory cannabinoids, however, the exact effects of these are being studied by our esteemed group of scientists. What we do know is that even after you extract the full spectrum of cannabinoids from the plant, the ratio of THC to CBD has far and away the largest impact on the effects we feel.\n\nPLUS has been a consistent leader in low-dose edibles. You can always take more, but you can’t take less. The ability to adjust your intake and tailor the magnitude of the effects allows even the most experienced cannabis consumers to find their just right. The world moves fast, and so do we. As new technologies and techniques advance, PLUS will continue to be at the forefront of real cannabis science.","informationWebsite":"https://plusproducts.com","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":true,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/WahuQIPpQrWmGdJoKCgc_PLUS_balance_logo.png","name":"PLUS Products","tagline":"Find Your Just Right"},"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Edibles","categorySlug":"edibles","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":0,"description":"Tranquility and calm escaping you?
