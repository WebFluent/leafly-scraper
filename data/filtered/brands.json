What followed was a philosophy and lifestyle that adds cannabis where it counts. Our patients have continiously sent us thank you letters, stories of survival and blessed comments for our products. Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds. Disappointed by unsatisfying so-called medicated edibles, we set out to create our own to share with other marijuana patients, just like us.\n  \nWhat was discovered on our journey was a surprise — Drinks! What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona. Each brownie, candy, lolly, and infusion from our kitchen are available in a wide assortment of flavors and dosages. With our traffic light dosing system we produce over 200 products. We hope you can easily locate the right product for you and be sure to let your dispensary agent know which products you’re interested in.","informationWebsite":"http://www.yilo.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/DawYD9T8RXiexlWGTPuQ_pasted_image_at_2017_07_06_10_28_am_360.png","name":"Yilo","tagline":"The Finest Marijuana Edibles!"},{"id":9872,"slug":"item-9-labs","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Founded on friendships, motivated by quality, driven with community.","informationWebsite":"http://www.item9labs.com","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/yAlnSHjfSvUOSDhGei2a_leaflinkprofilepic.png","name":"Item 9 Labs","tagline":"In Good Times And Good Health"},{"id":19823,"slug":"genesis-bioceuticals","availableCountries":["Canada","United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Here at Genesis Bioceuticals, We Embrace Nature and Technology to Cultivate Arizona's Finest Cannabis.

Using innovative techniques ensures the quality of our product that is far superior to any competitive Medical Marijuana facility in Arizona. \n\nHow it began: Tierra Grow's majority owner was working on his own electrical business when his sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The medication she needed to control her pain was opiate-based and making her just as sick as the cancer itself. He knew several people who used Cannabis as a form of medicine to help with pain, nausea, and sleep. Although, he did not have considerable knowledge about how Cannabis was grown, he knew it may be what his sister needed. \n\nIn 2014 he started reaching out to several professionals and home growers; what he discovered was astonishing. As it turned out, many growers used non-organic, harmful pesticides on their crops. So, he took it upon himself to learn how to cultivate clean Cannabis.\n\nGoing through this experience and seeing the affects of opiate-based pain medication versus Cannabis was a turning point. He knew that if it helped his ailing sister, it could help others and he wanted to be a part of that. \nBy 2015 his vision came to fruition; to grow the best possible Cannabis on a large-scale to meet the needs of as many patients as possible. \n\n*Tierra Grow is an indoor 40,000sqft Facility. It is the supplier of top-quality cannabis to our sister companies Core Concentrates and Mockingbird Botanicals.

Using innovative techniques ensures the quality of our product that is far superior to any competitive Medical Marijuana facility in Arizona. \n\nHow it began: Tierra Grow's majority owner was working on his own electrical business when his sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The medication she needed to control her pain was opiate-based and making her just as sick as the cancer itself. He knew several people who used Cannabis as a form of medicine to help with pain, nausea, and sleep. Although, he did not have considerable knowledge about how Cannabis was grown, he knew it may be what his sister needed. \n\nIn 2014 he started reaching out to several professionals and home growers; what he discovered was astonishing. As it turned out, many growers used non-organic, harmful pesticides on their crops. So, he took it upon himself to learn how to cultivate clean Cannabis.\n\nGoing through this experience and seeing the affects of opiate-based pain medication versus Cannabis was a turning point. He knew that if it helped his ailing sister, it could help others and he wanted to be a part of that. \nBy 2015 his vision came to fruition; to grow the best possible Cannabis on a large-scale to meet the needs of as many patients as possible. \n\n*Tierra Grow is an indoor 40,000sqft Facility. It is the supplier of top-quality cannabis to our sister companies Core Concentrates and Mockingbird Botanicals.

Using innovative techniques ensures the quality of our product that is far superior to any competitive Medical Marijuana facility in Arizona. \n\nHow it began: Tierra Grow's majority owner was working on his own electrical business when his sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The medication she needed to control her pain was opiate-based and making her just as sick as the cancer itself. He knew several people who used Cannabis as a form of medicine to help with pain, nausea, and sleep. Although, he did not have considerable knowledge about how Cannabis was grown, he knew it may be what his sister needed. \n\nIn 2014 he started reaching out to several professionals and home growers; what he discovered was astonishing. As it turned out, many growers used non-organic, harmful pesticides on their crops. So, he took it upon himself to learn how to cultivate clean Cannabis.\n\nGoing through this experience and seeing the affects of opiate-based pain medication versus Cannabis was a turning point. He knew that if it helped his ailing sister, it could help others and he wanted to be a part of that. \nBy 2015 his vision came to fruition; to grow the best possible Cannabis on a large-scale to meet the needs of as many patients as possible. \n\n*Tierra Grow is an indoor 40,000sqft Facility. It is the supplier of top-quality cannabis to our sister companies Core Concentrates and Mockingbird Botanicals.

It’s an icon, a legend, an idea, a philosophy, and, to True Humboldt, it’s even a mission. We believe cannabis can play a healing role in a patient’s life. Physically. Emotionally. Environmentally. Even spiritually. That’s why we’ve dedicated ourselves to offering the best cannabis and services available anywhere.\n\nWhile we obsess about maintaining the world-renowned tradition of Humboldt’s superior quality, we also focused on breaking new ground in getting our excess medicine to patients that need it. By helping farmers and dispensaries smooth the reimbursement process, we’ve successfully developed a complete distribution network throughout the state.\n\nWe’re a growing network of farmers.\nWe’re run by a conscience, not a corporation. The founding members have lived in Humboldt for an average of 25 years. We raise our families in Humboldt, and we run our businesses throughout Humboldt County and in Arcata. We’re always interested in talking to like-minded farmers, so get in touch with us if you’d like to preserve the tradition of Humboldt quality and craft.\n\nWe work closely together.\nBy working together, we’re lowering the costs of production, establishing standards for superior consistency and quality control, competing in a competitive branded market, and preserving the heritage of Humboldt’s most notorious commodity.\n\nWe’re community-minded.\nWe’re not just a collective of farmers who share our accumulated knowledge and experience with each other. We also employ members of our community whenever possible and pay them living wages. We also work with local environmental engineers, lumber and construction companies, soil labs, nurseries, accountants, and more. Because we believe we’re all in it together.\n\nWe’re evolving.\nAlthough we’ve been around for a while, we know reform is on its way and that we need to adapt. This requires vision and the ability to thrive in a new environment. We’re already leading by example, too. We are seeking to fully permit our farms and are actively pursuing compliance with county regulatory agencies.\n\nWe’re craftsmen.\nSome craftsmen work with hammers and saws. We work with the earth, flowers, and sun. Each True Humboldt farmer is dedicated to carrying on the tradition of quality.","informationWebsite":"http://www.truehumboldt.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/prvsV5IdSWZClWe3a4AA","name":"True Humboldt","tagline":"Premium Sungrown Cannabis"},{"id":13350,"slug":"strane","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"We’re all about the story of each strain, and the needs and tastes of each medical patient and adult-use enthusiast.

The golden hills area, known Natively as Kiona, is a renowned terroir for vineyards and craft horticuture. Our all-natural, sun grown techniques combine traditional and modern methods to produce connoisseur-grade Cannabis with minimal environmental impact.\n \nRespect for biological diversity and genetic integrity is at the heart of our work. Commercial production of Cannabis has reduced its range of desirable traits and effects. We’re dedicated to preserving the distinctive highs and unique character of great tropical and heirloom lineages. Our curated selection of rare strains includes nearly psychedelic African hazes, spiritual Central American landraces and cherished California “hippie” weeds.\n \n~ From our master grower’s notebook ~\nLegal psychoactive Cannabis allows for more than just recreational and medicinal use. Cannabis has an equally long, if not longer, history of use for divination, meditation, and magico-religious purposes, as an entheogen, as it does a narcotic. Even in western societies, as recent as the 1960s and 70s, Cannabis was part of the jazz, beat and psychedelic movements, used as a tool for introspection and expansion of consciousness. \n \nOver the last 30 years, we’ve seen a focus on Cannabis as more of a stupefacient and narcotic. This is not to say that devotees of traditional Cannabis haven’t been grumbling the entire time. Connoisseurs have been lamenting the loss of intellectually, and spiritually stimulating pot, in exchange for what was at first the infiltration of domestically grown indica, and what later became a genetically bottlenecked, poly-hybridized gene pool, high in THC, and possessing an dizzying array of flavors, but homogeneous in its ability to produce a bland, sedative effect, of limited utility to the artists, gifted academics, and spiritual sages who once embraced the species for its ability to enhance their intellectual and spiritual lives.","informationWebsite":"http://kionathc.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Kiona","tagline":"Tropical & Heirloom Cannabis"},{"id":12916,"slug":"nectar-farms","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"We are a premium small batch, boutique style grow specializing in exotic strains.","informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/x7N5SPmjTY2M3rKUhNKm_95582-AZNectar-SS.png","name":"AZ Nectar Farms","tagline":"The Connoisseurs Choice"},{"id":12909,"slug":"mayflower-medicinals","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Mayflower Medicinals is a local Commonwealth of Massachusetts cannabis brand dedicated to providing the highest quality medical cannabis products & services in a safe, secure and professionally managed environment.

Browsing a wide range of strains that boast names like “Blunicorn” or “Sour Best Tangie” can be overwhelming and confusing to many consumers. With Perch Harvests we are looking to simplify this process by grouping similar strains in categories known as Perch Effects. \n\nEach Perch Effect has a unique component and all Perch flower grouped within that Perch Effect has been reported to provide a similar impact and potential benefit to the consumer. This allows for you to more easily narrow down your decision while feeling comfortable to explore beyond your usual strain. Perch Harvests aims to give the consumer a level of confidence in their selection while also making a conscious decision around their desired effects.\n\nHow are strains grouped into a Perch Effect?\n\nOur team has taken the time to deep-dive into the strains available from Perch Harvests to provide an educated decision on categorizing. Reviewing such important factors as lineage, reported effects, and consumer feedback provide a guiding light on selecting the Perch Effect each strain is grouped under. Our research doesn’t stop there, we include terpene results from a 3rd party laboratory to solidify our hypothesis on the interaction of each cannabis strain with the consumer.\n\nWhat are the 3 categories of Perch Effects?\n\nPerch Effect: Nest\nNest will contain strains known to have more relaxing and calming values. This is most notably the Indica-Dominant varietals often having higher amounts of the terpenes Linalool and Myrcene. These strains are popular for individuals yearning for a “couch-lock” sensation.\n\nPerch Effect: Hover\nHover will feature strains that have a good balance of relaxation and mood enhancement from their consumer’s reported effects. Containing a variety of hybrids, Hover is a great option for consumers not looking for a particular overarching effect and may want the flexibility to consume cannabis on their own schedule.\n\nPerch Effect: Fly\nFly is the final of the 3 Perch Effects, featuring strains known to be energizing and motivating for some individuals. Often having a higher proportion of Limonene, Humulene, and Pinene this effect will contain a majority of the Sativas in each harvest.","informationWebsite":"https://ma.temescalwellness.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":true,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/oLWpXSK8RYe5TKt1oStX_Weedmaps---Logo.png","name":"Perch Harvests","tagline":"Perch Harvests | Now Available at Temescal Wellness of MA"},{"id":9927,"slug":"bula-farms","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Top Shelf Cannabis Farm in the Hood River Valley.

Browsing a wide range of strains that boast names like “Blunicorn” or “Sour Best Tangie” can be overwhelming and confusing to many consumers. With Perch Harvests we are looking to simplify this process by grouping similar strains in categories known as Perch Effects. \n\nEach Perch Effect has a unique component and all Perch flower grouped within that Perch Effect has been reported to provide a similar impact and potential benefit to the consumer. This allows for you to more easily narrow down your decision while feeling comfortable to explore beyond your usual strain. Perch Harvests aims to give the consumer a level of confidence in their selection while also making a conscious decision around their desired effects.\n\nHow are strains grouped into a Perch Effect?\n\nOur team has taken the time to deep-dive into the strains available from Perch Harvests to provide an educated decision on categorizing. Reviewing such important factors as lineage, reported effects, and consumer feedback provide a guiding light on selecting the Perch Effect each strain is grouped under. Our research doesn’t stop there, we include terpene results from a 3rd party laboratory to solidify our hypothesis on the interaction of each cannabis strain with the consumer.\n\nWhat are the 3 categories of Perch Effects?\n\nPerch Effect: Nest\nNest will contain strains known to have more relaxing and calming values. This is most notably the Indica-Dominant varietals often having higher amounts of the terpenes Linalool and Myrcene. These strains are popular for individuals yearning for a “couch-lock” sensation.\n\nPerch Effect: Hover\nHover will feature strains that have a good balance of relaxation and mood enhancement from their consumer’s reported effects. Containing a variety of hybrids, Hover is a great option for consumers not looking for a particular overarching effect and may want the flexibility to consume cannabis on their own schedule.\n\nPerch Effect: Fly\nFly is the final of the 3 Perch Effects, featuring strains known to be energizing and motivating for some individuals. Often having a higher proportion of Limonene, Humulene, and Pinene this effect will contain a majority of the Sativas in each harvest.","informationWebsite":"https://ma.temescalwellness.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":true,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/oLWpXSK8RYe5TKt1oStX_Weedmaps---Logo.png","name":"Perch Harvests","tagline":"Perch Harvests | Now Available at Temescal Wellness of MA"},{"id":4565,"slug":"falcanna","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Welcome to the Falcanna website and thank you for your interest in our products.

ForwardGro Medical Director, Dr. Deb Kimless, has been actively pursuing data through pro bono individualized treatments of patients suffering from a range of conditions including: epilepsy, arthritis, cancer and pain management. In states where medical cannabis is currently legal, she has assisted patients in developing tailored treatment plans using different methods of administration, and varying cannabinoid ratios to influence patient response. A specialist in the Endocannabinoid System (ECS), a signaling system that maintains physiological balance throughout the body, she’s demonstrated how cannabis treatments work with the ECS to treat pain and other medical conditions. Additional and ongoing research demonstrates the potential for cannabis-related treatments for disease and other medical conditions far beyond what is currently known. Dr Kimless is an internationally recognized speaker.\r\n\r\nForwardGro Patient Advocate, Gail Rand, who has a family member who suffers from epilepsy, became passionately involved in the Maryland legislature in 2013 as a parent advocate. She played an integral role in helping to pass the 2014 medical cannabis legislation in Maryland, as well as the 2015 legislation that further improved the program.

Even spiritually. That’s why we’ve dedicated ourselves to offering the best cannabis and services available anywhere.\n\nWhile we obsess about maintaining the world-renowned tradition of Humboldt’s superior quality, we also focused on breaking new ground in getting our excess medicine to patients that need it.

We also employ members of our community whenever possible and pay them living wages.

Cannabis has an equally long, if not longer, history of use for divination, meditation, and magico-religious purposes, as an entheogen, as it does a narcotic. Even in western societies, as recent as the 1960s and 70s, Cannabis was part of the jazz, beat and psychedelic movements, used as a tool for introspection and expansion of consciousness. \n \nOver the last 30 years, we’ve seen a focus on Cannabis as more of a stupefacient and narcotic.

Our all-natural, sun grown techniques combine traditional and modern methods to produce connoisseur-grade Cannabis with minimal environmental impact.\n \nRespect for biological diversity and genetic integrity is at the heart of our work. Commercial production of Cannabis has reduced its range of desirable traits and effects.

Cannabis has an equally long, if not longer, history of use for divination, meditation, and magico-religious purposes, as an entheogen, as it does a narcotic. Even in western societies, as recent as the 1960s and 70s, Cannabis was part of the jazz, beat and psychedelic movements, used as a tool for introspection and expansion of consciousness. \n \nOver the last 30 years, we’ve seen a focus on Cannabis as more of a stupefacient and narcotic. This is not to say that devotees of traditional Cannabis haven’t been grumbling the entire time. Connoisseurs have been lamenting the loss of intellectually, and spiritually stimulating pot, in exchange for what was at first the infiltration of domestically grown indica, and what later became a genetically bottlenecked, poly-hybridized gene pool, high in THC, and possessing an dizzying array of flavors, but homogeneous in its ability to produce a bland, sedative effect, of limited utility to the artists, gifted academics, and spiritual sages who once embraced the species for its ability to enhance their intellectual and spiritual lives.","informationWebsite":"http://kionathc.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Kiona","tagline":"Tropical & Heirloom Cannabis"},{"id":12328,"slug":"ayra","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Ayra grows the highest quality premium cannabis in the mosts sustainable and responsible way. 100% aeroponic. 100% LED.

We have expanded to an OLCC Licensed production company. It’s not easy managing the business dynamics of an emerging industry. We constantly have to adapt and actively pursue compliance with county and state regulatory agencies. But, hard work and dedication have brought us to the present day. We value our relationships with current and future customers and hope to communicate our appreciation to them through our product quality. \r\n\r\nWe owe a huge thanks to everyone for supporting us on this awesome journey, and we hope that we can continue to do what we’re passionate about and help our community. Our staff and facility has grown but we still remain locally owned, locally grown, and true to our roots.","informationWebsite":"http://pdxorganicfarms.com/#","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/1YZfQOgIRdWkG6sxHGSH_20431480_685260488330388_8845494092320336870_n.jpg","name":"PDX Organics","tagline":"Hand Crafted Cannabis"},{"id":4834,"slug":"noble-farms","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"We are a small, family owned, boutique craft cannabis producer located in Eagle Creek near the Clackamas river.

Each patient is our passion and we bake, extract, cook, and create every YiLo medical marijuana product with them in mind. We invite you to share in the medical benefits of cannabis and that YiLo is the premier medical marijuana edible and extract manufacturer.\n  \nWith our over-the-top, on-the-go lives we were desperate for a truly medicated brownie that was effective in helping to treat illness and taste great – something that would tickle our taste buds.

What better way to cool down and quench a real ‘thirst’ with our newest product to date. They are extremely refreshing and delicous. From coffee, teas to juices and potions, YiLo made a cannabis infused liquid for every patient.\n  \n We also love making delicious gooey Sugar Free treats. These gems are the perfect way to stay medicated and not worry about your blood glucose.\n  \nYiLo was developed to meet the growing demand for medicated edibles. We offer a variety of sizes based on the amount of THC. Using German quality standards we provide lab tested products with consistent THC levels. Our consistent dosages are based on a traffic light system to assure the dose is right for you: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC and Red 180mg THC. Based on many requests we also developed purple 240mg THC and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. Yilo products can be found in almost all dispensaries in Arizona (AZ).\n\nTo bring you the best of what cannabis has to offer, YiLo sources 100% high-grade medical marijuana from our own cultivation in Arizona.

The founders and its team have a deep history of fostering the symbiotic relationship between cannabis as plant medicine, with creatives such as artists, designers and musicians.\n\nWonderbrett also built one of the largest cultivation facilities in North America. Headquartered in Long Beach, Calif., the operation features custom-designed irrigation systems that integrate advanced technology with time-honored, traditional cultivation techniques. This ensures craft-style, premium products at scale and the continuous development of elite genetics from Californian legacy cultivators. \n\nIn 2021, Wonderbrett will unveil its North American dispensary flagship on North La Brea Avenue in the iconic Fairfax District of Los Angeles. The store is a result of Wonderbrett founders receiving a social equity retail license in 2018 from L.A. County’s cannabis commission.

Our soil is forever improving with the passing of time, as every discarded part of the plant is returned to the soil for regeneration. Wildcrafting also serves as an integral piece of our regenerative mission.\n\nWe ferment and store all of our supplemental plant nutrients, which are directly sourced and gathered from our farm. With a little help from micro and macro biology, we are able to completely eliminate the need for bottled nutrients. This careful construction of our closed-loop system fuels the vigorous growth of our plants and forms one of the pillars of our “Legendary Cultivation” moniker.\n\nLarge or small, each and every plant is given individual, daily attention throughout its life cycle. Careful and constant observation is a major component to a plant’s healthy growth. In our commitment to deepen the level of individualized care, we avoid automation in exchange for the hand watering, sculpting, and inspecting of each plant based on its own unique needs. This keeps our team intimately connected with the garden as a whole and creates an endless stream of natural energy interchanging and strengthening the entire ecosystem.

Browsing a wide range of strains that boast names like “Blunicorn” or “Sour Best Tangie” can be overwhelming and confusing to many consumers. With Perch Harvests we are looking to simplify this process by grouping similar strains in categories known as Perch Effects. \n\nEach Perch Effect has a unique component and all Perch flower grouped within that Perch Effect has been reported to provide a similar impact and potential benefit to the consumer. This allows for you to more easily narrow down your decision while feeling comfortable to explore beyond your usual strain. Perch Harvests aims to give the consumer a level of confidence in their selection while also making a conscious decision around their desired effects.\n\nHow are strains grouped into a Perch Effect?\n\nOur team has taken the time to deep-dive into the strains available from Perch Harvests to provide an educated decision on categorizing. Reviewing such important factors as lineage, reported effects, and consumer feedback provide a guiding light on selecting the Perch Effect each strain is grouped under. Our research doesn’t stop there, we include terpene results from a 3rd party laboratory to solidify our hypothesis on the interaction of each cannabis strain with the consumer.\n\nWhat are the 3 categories of Perch Effects?\n\nPerch Effect: Nest\nNest will contain strains known to have more relaxing and calming values. This is most notably the Indica-Dominant varietals often having higher amounts of the terpenes Linalool and Myrcene. These strains are popular for individuals yearning for a “couch-lock” sensation.\n\nPerch Effect: Hover\nHover will feature strains that have a good balance of relaxation and mood enhancement from their consumer’s reported effects. Containing a variety of hybrids, Hover is a great option for consumers not looking for a particular overarching effect and may want the flexibility to consume cannabis on their own schedule.\n\nPerch Effect: Fly\nFly is the final of the 3 Perch Effects, featuring strains known to be energizing and motivating for some individuals. Often having a higher proportion of Limonene, Humulene, and Pinene this effect will contain a majority of the Sativas in each harvest.","informationWebsite":"https://ma.temescalwellness.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":true,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/oLWpXSK8RYe5TKt1oStX_Weedmaps---Logo.png","name":"Perch Harvests","tagline":"Perch Harvests | Now Available at Temescal Wellness of MA"},{"id":11031,"slug":"meraki-gardens","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"We are a Female owned and Family operated indoor garden.

Using innovative techniques ensures the quality of our product that is far superior to any competitive Medical Marijuana facility in Arizona. \n\nHow it began: Tierra Grow's majority owner was working on his own electrical business when his sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The medication she needed to control her pain was opiate-based and making her just as sick as the cancer itself. He knew several people who used Cannabis as a form of medicine to help with pain, nausea, and sleep. Although, he did not have considerable knowledge about how Cannabis was grown, he knew it may be what his sister needed. \n\nIn 2014 he started reaching out to several professionals and home growers; what he discovered was astonishing. As it turned out, many growers used non-organic, harmful pesticides on their crops. So, he took it upon himself to learn how to cultivate clean Cannabis.\n\nGoing through this experience and seeing the affects of opiate-based pain medication versus Cannabis was a turning point. He knew that if it helped his ailing sister, it could help others and he wanted to be a part of that. \nBy 2015 his vision came to fruition; to grow the best possible Cannabis on a large-scale to meet the needs of as many patients as possible. \n\n*Tierra Grow is an indoor 40,000sqft Facility.

First Cut Farms is rooted in Covelo, in the Heart of the Emerald Triangle. Founder and Cultivator, Jerry Munn is a long-time, passionate cannabis activist with over 30 years of experience in cannabis cultivation and advocacy. His life's journey is dedicated to providing world-class cannabis to you. \n\nJerry has grown and cultivated indoor, outdoor and hydroponic gardens, from the cities to the mountains. His favorite style is outdoor, full-term, sun-grown, big trees. He enjoys nature and working in the elements. His love of cannabis is evident in his lifestyle and his daily schedule. He works with cannabis nearly every minute he's awake.  \n\nFirst Cut Farms is situated in Appellation Covelo which has a rich cultivation history. Covelo is an eco-system and micro-climate where cannabis plants thrive in the extreme temperature swings, the wind, rain, and Mendocino sunshine. Planting during the new moon, nutrient-rich, native soil and sparkling, pure, PH and alkaline balanced water help developing plants flourish and grow huge, strong, and frosty. That, plus organic inputs, eco-consciousness, regenerative farming methods, water conservation, composting, Grateful Dead playing to the plants, handcrafted farming, sacred seeds, and LOVE make First Cut Farms cannabis flowers unique and desired.  \n\nJerry creates sophisticated and complex cannabis cultivars. First Cut Farms is committed to producing new strains that have amazing flavors and effects. As a cannabis breeder, Jerry's developed proprietary strains that yield massive plants and dense buds with high oil production and potency. He creates high THC strains with unusual and full-flavored terps. Jerry breeds high-yielding seeds which ultimately contain the most distinctive and tastiest terps for the stoniest and most superb highs.\n\nAs a young adult, Jerry risked his freedom during the Aids crisis in the early 1990s, a time when medical treatment was unavailable to patients. He made certain HIV/Aids and cancer patients received their sacred medicine in a timely, dignified manner. If they were physically capable & interested, he taught them how to set up indoor gardens to grow and cultivate for themselves. Patients were never charged for his services. That is the spirit of cannabis. Jerry cultivated for & worked at the first Buyer's Club in San Francisco. His Mentor for almost 30 years was the legendary Dennis Peron, hero, to all cannabis patients and enthusiasts.  Dennis fought tirelessly for cannabis reform among many other successful crusades.  Dennis wrote Prop 215. \n\nJerry literally lived on a mountain under a log in Mendocino and grew cannabis for patients in need. Jerry's experience shows that cannabis cultivation requires extreme perseverance, dedication, physical strength, patience, and knowledge in farming, horticulture, biology, engineering, and social and political sciences.\n\nJerry is grateful and thankful for his mentors, friends, cultivators, cannabis lovers and the pioneers in his life, and the ones that gave their lives and freedom to bring cannabis to the people under all circumstances. First Cut Farms grows for everyone that cares about having high-quality cannabis. Friends of First Cut Farms, including fellow growers, savor the flavors and highs from this uncommon cannabis grown and bred in Covelo.\n\nFirst Cut Farms stands firmly in philanthropy.

Browsing a wide range of strains that boast names like “Blunicorn” or “Sour Best Tangie” can be overwhelming and confusing to many consumers. With Perch Harvests we are looking to simplify this process by grouping similar strains in categories known as Perch Effects. \n\nEach Perch Effect has a unique component and all Perch flower grouped within that Perch Effect has been reported to provide a similar impact and potential benefit to the consumer. This allows for you to more easily narrow down your decision while feeling comfortable to explore beyond your usual strain. Perch Harvests aims to give the consumer a level of confidence in their selection while also making a conscious decision around their desired effects.\n\nHow are strains grouped into a Perch Effect?\n\nOur team has taken the time to deep-dive into the strains available from Perch Harvests to provide an educated decision on categorizing. Reviewing such important factors as lineage, reported effects, and consumer feedback provide a guiding light on selecting the Perch Effect each strain is grouped under. Our research doesn’t stop there, we include terpene results from a 3rd party laboratory to solidify our hypothesis on the interaction of each cannabis strain with the consumer.\n\nWhat are the 3 categories of Perch Effects?\n\nPerch Effect: Nest\nNest will contain strains known to have more relaxing and calming values. This is most notably the Indica-Dominant varietals often having higher amounts of the terpenes Linalool and Myrcene. These strains are popular for individuals yearning for a “couch-lock” sensation.\n\nPerch Effect: Hover\nHover will feature strains that have a good balance of relaxation and mood enhancement from their consumer’s reported effects.

First Cut Farms is rooted in Covelo, in the Heart of the Emerald Triangle. Founder and Cultivator, Jerry Munn is a long-time, passionate cannabis activist with over 30 years of experience in cannabis cultivation and advocacy. His life's journey is dedicated to providing world-class cannabis to you. \n\nJerry has grown and cultivated indoor, outdoor and hydroponic gardens, from the cities to the mountains. His favorite style is outdoor, full-term, sun-grown, big trees. He enjoys nature and working in the elements. His love of cannabis is evident in his lifestyle and his daily schedule. He works with cannabis nearly every minute he's awake.  \n\nFirst Cut Farms is situated in Appellation Covelo which has a rich cultivation history. Covelo is an eco-system and micro-climate where cannabis plants thrive in the extreme temperature swings, the wind, rain, and Mendocino sunshine. Planting during the new moon, nutrient-rich, native soil and sparkling, pure, PH and alkaline balanced water help developing plants flourish and grow huge, strong, and frosty. That, plus organic inputs, eco-consciousness, regenerative farming methods, water conservation, composting, Grateful Dead playing to the plants, handcrafted farming, sacred seeds, and LOVE make First Cut Farms cannabis flowers unique and desired.  \n\nJerry creates sophisticated and complex cannabis cultivars. First Cut Farms is committed to producing new strains that have amazing flavors and effects. As a cannabis breeder, Jerry's developed proprietary strains that yield massive plants and dense buds with high oil production and potency. He creates high THC strains with unusual and full-flavored terps. Jerry breeds high-yielding seeds which ultimately contain the most distinctive and tastiest terps for the stoniest and most superb highs.\n\nAs a young adult, Jerry risked his freedom during the Aids crisis in the early 1990s, a time when medical treatment was unavailable to patients. He made certain HIV/Aids and cancer patients received their sacred medicine in a timely, dignified manner. If they were physically capable & interested, he taught them how to set up indoor gardens to grow and cultivate for themselves. Patients were never charged for his services. That is the spirit of cannabis. Jerry cultivated for & worked at the first Buyer's Club in San Francisco. His Mentor for almost 30 years was the legendary Dennis Peron, hero, to all cannabis patients and enthusiasts.  Dennis fought tirelessly for cannabis reform among many other successful crusades.  Dennis wrote Prop 215. \n\nJerry literally lived on a mountain under a log in Mendocino and grew cannabis for patients in need. Jerry's experience shows that cannabis cultivation requires extreme perseverance, dedication, physical strength, patience, and knowledge in farming, horticulture, biology, engineering, and social and political sciences.\n\nJerry is grateful and thankful for his mentors, friends, cultivators, cannabis lovers and the pioneers in his life, and the ones that gave their lives and freedom to bring cannabis to the people under all circumstances. First Cut Farms grows for everyone that cares about having high-quality cannabis. Friends of First Cut Farms, including fellow growers, savor the flavors and highs from this uncommon cannabis grown and bred in Covelo.\n\nFirst Cut Farms stands firmly in philanthropy. Recent memberships and sponsorships include Covelo Cannabis Advocacy Group, Mendocino Cannabis Alliance, the 1st Annual Bay Area Cannabis Pride Event, and Jerry Day 2019 in San Francisco bringing music to the people at no cost to the people.  First Cut Farms will continue to support important causes. \nContinuing education is provided for Jerry's First Cut Farms family. He an active member of the Covelo community. \n\nJerry's a small grower, operating purposefully, with no investors & no corporate influence.  First Cut Farms pledges to provide consistency and excellent individualized service. \n\nYour support of First Cut Farms validates the efforts of a man who is committed to delivering cannabis that will heal the world.

As demand for CBD-rich strains increased, a solution was needed to increase the availability without sacrificing the quality.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Giving Tree Farms began the process of implementing greenhouse environments.This greenhouse system enabled the more frequent sungrown crops using light-deprivation methods to increase the availability and consistency.\r\n\r\nWithout forgoing product quality, the light-dep process mimics the sungrown experience and allows a plant to flower in a time of year that it would not naturally - when cultivated using traditional sungrown methods. This process utilizes a retractable blackout curtain system to block the sunlight and also can be used to prevent light pollution. The breathable walls and cover are able to allow ventilation for full airflow passage, while the plants are in total darkness in the greenhouse. This innovative system allows crops to be in a vegetative and bloom phase year round. \r\n\r\nSuccession Planting\r\nGiving Tree Farms utilizes succession planting to ensure a consistent supply of flowers to take to market. In a traditional cultivation environment, a farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. Using a succession method allows Giving Tree Farms to have product ready to take to market every few months.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Impact\r\nWith the implications of climate change, water and energy consumption have become a serious concern for the cannabis industry. Giving Tree Farms has found the usage of the greenhouse coupled with a raised pallet for aeration and CocoTek mats for holding moisture significantly reduces the amount of water consumption compared to sungrown cultivation required to flower the same strains. \r\n\r\nInnovations in energy technology now give cultivators choices. With the advancements in solar power and LED-fitted lamps Giving Tree Farms has the opportunity to take control of their environmental footprint and are working towards reduce their consumption requirements. \r\n\r\nThese developments allow for products that rival sungrown and indoor quality without the energy consumption of a traditional indoor operation.

In August of that same year, we incorporated and began our journey as the first commercial cannabis production company the state had ever seen. From inception our goal has been to present the plant in the most beautiful way possible; to search far and wide for the best varieties; to cultivate them in an environmentally responsible way; to test, breed, and develop varieties in search of different specific applications; to be a positive participant in the communities we operate and provide a new message for cannabis.

Kings Cannabis is an expression of cannabis admiration. Cultivating the most exquisite flower, so that Oregon can experience cannabis at its’ very finest.\n\nHistory\n\nKings Cannabis was founded in Eugene, Oregon, a city bright and vibrant with cannabis culture, and was created from a passion for cannabis, its’ properties and their benefits.  The founders, having been involved in cannabis most their lives, began in 2012 to focus and hone their skills as growers. Adding the talents of a master grower with over a decade of experience in cultivation, they developed a deep understanding of cannabis, allowing them to continually increase the qualities of terpenes and phytocannabinoids in every bud.\n\nAfter years of hard work developing organic cultivation methods, Kings Cannabis launched in 2015. Since then, Kings Cannabis has remained committed to producing the cleanest, most robust flowers on the market while continuing their momentum toward absolute perfection.\n\nProcess\n\nThe Kings Cannabis difference is in the attention to detail and unwavering dedication to quality. Kings Cannabis master growers cultivate in soil at their indoor garden, watering and tending to their plants by hand and growing with entirely organic cultivation methods, without the use of growth hormones. Every plant is fed with techniques that bring out the natural flavors of the strain, allowing you to taste the plant and not the nutrients. Utilizing the best lighting systems, having complete control over the climate conditions and making sure only the best goes into their plants has allowed Kings Cannabis to yield buds that develop as they would in their native environment.\n\nKings Cannabis unique curing process allows the entire plant to remain whole as it dries, resulting in ripe buds that express even brighter flavors and effects.\n\nLab Testing\n\nKings Cannabis has all of their cannabis products tested by Oregon Analytical Services. In their continued dedication to quality, Kings Cannabis goes above and beyond the standard compliance testing (which includes potency, moisture, mildew, and pesticides) and provides the full terpenes profiles for all their flower.","informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/jHgzcsBlRziGTcY9Rqhi_LOGO%20Black%20on%20White%20w:Gold%20Crown%20.png","name":"Kings Cannabis","tagline":"Smoke Like Royalty"},{"id":11279,"slug":"patriot-care","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Patriot Care","informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Patriot Care","tagline":"Patriot Care "},{"id":8396,"slug":"wonderbrett","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Wonderbrett is a legendary West Coast cannabis lifestyle brand founded in 1997 by elite California legacy cultivators Brett Feldman and Cameron Damwijk.

With Perch Harvests we are looking to simplify this process by grouping similar strains in categories known as Perch Effects. \n\nEach Perch Effect has a unique component and all Perch flower grouped within that Perch Effect has been reported to provide a similar impact and potential benefit to the consumer. This allows for you to more easily narrow down your decision while feeling comfortable to explore beyond your usual strain. Perch Harvests aims to give the consumer a level of confidence in their selection while also making a conscious decision around their desired effects.\n\nHow are strains grouped into a Perch Effect?\n\nOur team has taken the time to deep-dive into the strains available from Perch Harvests to provide an educated decision on categorizing. Reviewing such important factors as lineage, reported effects, and consumer feedback provide a guiding light on selecting the Perch Effect each strain is grouped under. Our research doesn’t stop there, we include terpene results from a 3rd party laboratory to solidify our hypothesis on the interaction of each cannabis strain with the consumer.\n\nWhat are the 3 categories of Perch Effects?\n\nPerch Effect: Nest\nNest will contain strains known to have more relaxing and calming values. This is most notably the Indica-Dominant varietals often having higher amounts of the terpenes Linalool and Myrcene. These strains are popular for individuals yearning for a “couch-lock” sensation.\n\nPerch Effect: Hover\nHover will feature strains that have a good balance of relaxation and mood enhancement from their consumer’s reported effects. Containing a variety of hybrids, Hover is a great option for consumers not looking for a particular overarching effect and may want the flexibility to consume cannabis on their own schedule.\n\nPerch Effect: Fly\nFly is the final of the 3 Perch Effects, featuring strains known to be energizing and motivating for some individuals. Often having a higher proportion of Limonene, Humulene, and Pinene this effect will contain a majority of the Sativas in each harvest.","informationWebsite":"https://ma.temescalwellness.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":true,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/oLWpXSK8RYe5TKt1oStX_Weedmaps---Logo.png","name":"Perch Harvests","tagline":"Perch Harvests | Now Available at Temescal Wellness of MA"},{"id":11674,"slug":"korova-edibles-az","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Founded in 2011, Korova established itself as one of the most renowned purveyors of unrivaled cannabis products.","informationWebsite":"http://www.korovaedibles.com/arizona","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/oCF0c9pT6LpWXzC1KMpA_korovaCowLogoNEW-01.png","name":"Korova","tagline":"You can always eat more, but you can't eat less."},{"id":10853,"slug":"sunmed-growers","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Setting the Standard for Clean, Natural & Sustainable Medical Cannabis Cultivation. \n\nMarrying science, passion and hard work to grow medicine from the sun, the company stands alone in Maryland’s cannabis industry as the only grower to utilize state-of-the-art “Dutch” style greenhouse practices.

We share a love of land, ecology, and diversity. During the last 25 years we have developed a unique growing style that produces exceptionally healthy plants and remarkably resinous flowers, utilizing all natural and organic inputs. Our focus is on living soil, modeled closely on the processes we learn directly from nature.\nWe hold ourselves to the highest environmental standards, utilizing biodynamic principles and closed-loop systems, minimizing the carbon footprint of every plant that we grow. We strive to lead by example in the ever-expanding cannabis community, working to educate consumers and growers alike about the ecological benefits and superior quality potential of our sustainable grow model.\n\nThe secret to our Legendary Cultivation is our respect for the growing process as a perpetual cycle. We believe that the many symbiotic relationships within a healthy ecosystem create our renewed, naturally rich growing conditions.Our custom living soil recipe has been continually evolving through years of real world practice and experimentation. Our soil is forever improving with the passing of time, as every discarded part of the plant is returned to the soil for regeneration. Wildcrafting also serves as an integral piece of our regenerative mission.\n\nWe ferment and store all of our supplemental plant nutrients, which are directly sourced and gathered from our farm. With a little help from micro and macro biology, we are able to completely eliminate the need for bottled nutrients. This careful construction of our closed-loop system fuels the vigorous growth of our plants and forms one of the pillars of our “Legendary Cultivation” moniker.\n\nLarge or small, each and every plant is given individual, daily attention throughout its life cycle. Careful and constant observation is a major component to a plant’s healthy growth. In our commitment to deepen the level of individualized care, we avoid automation in exchange for the hand watering, sculpting, and inspecting of each plant based on its own unique needs. This keeps our team intimately connected with the garden as a whole and creates an endless stream of natural energy interchanging and strengthening the entire ecosystem. This time consuming and often costly process sets us far apart from the majority of automated, high-volume cannabis producers seen today, but in our opinion, it is only with such careful love and intent that superior, finished cannabis is grown.","informationWebsite":"https://gnomegrownorganics.com/our-farm/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/M67GNJmTGiMyfAmo5SfG_Gnome%20Grown_Logomark%20Vertical_Black-01.png","name":"Gnome Grown Organics","tagline":"Legendary Cultivation"},{"id":14765,"slug":"center-city-cultivation","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Center City Cultivation","tagline":null},{"id":12967,"slug":"livwell","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"LivWell","tagline":null},{"id":13366,"slug":"district-cannabis","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Growing at the “Highest Standard” is much more than a slogan, it’s the never ending pursuit of quality and consistency.

The medication she needed to control her pain was opiate-based and making her just as sick as the cancer itself. He knew several people who used Cannabis as a form of medicine to help with pain, nausea, and sleep. Although, he did not have considerable knowledge about how Cannabis was grown, he knew it may be what his sister needed. \n\nIn 2014 he started reaching out to several professionals and home growers; what he discovered was astonishing. As it turned out, many growers used non-organic, harmful pesticides on their crops. So, he took it upon himself to learn how to cultivate clean Cannabis.\n\nGoing through this experience and seeing the affects of opiate-based pain medication versus Cannabis was a turning point. He knew that if it helped his ailing sister, it could help others and he wanted to be a part of that. \nBy 2015 his vision came to fruition; to grow the best possible Cannabis on a large-scale to meet the needs of as many patients as possible. \n\n*Tierra Grow is an indoor 40,000sqft Facility. It is the supplier of top-quality cannabis to our sister companies Core Concentrates and Mockingbird Botanicals. Providing us the ability to control the quality of medicine throughout all three companies.","informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/ex2hCB2VR46ADuTuGtKs_Tierra-Grow-Linkedin-Icon.jpg","name":"Tierra Grow","tagline":"Good principles, Great Cannabis"},{"id":11279,"slug":"patriot-care","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Patriot Care","informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Patriot Care","tagline":"Patriot Care "},{"id":12396,"slug":"ideal-farms","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Ideal Farms","tagline":null},{"id":12960,"slug":"prich","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Prich","tagline":null},{"id":21129,"slug":"glass-house-farms","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Grown in Carpinteria Valley, famed for its orchid and daisy greenhouses, Glass House Farms cultivates its cannabis in sparkling clean, eco-friendly greenhouses using innovative environmental controls that; maximize the coastal sun’s benefit, eliminate harsh elements and bugs that tamper with quality, minimize waste, and maximize water retention with state-of-the-art recapture systems. \n\nEach flower is trimmed and packaged with exceeding care to deliver a consistently premium craft cannabis product.

This time consuming and often costly process sets us far apart from the majority of automated, high-volume cannabis producers seen today, but in our opinion, it is only with such careful love and intent that superior, finished cannabis is grown.","informationWebsite":"https://gnomegrownorganics.com/our-farm/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/M67GNJmTGiMyfAmo5SfG_Gnome%20Grown_Logomark%20Vertical_Black-01.png","name":"Gnome Grown Organics","tagline":"Legendary Cultivation"},{"id":12488,"slug":"growing-like-a-weed-glw","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Growing Like a Weed (GLW)","tagline":null},{"id":14765,"slug":"center-city-cultivation","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Center City Cultivation","tagline":null},{"id":10132,"slug":"driftboat","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Driftboat","informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/2feDXw6S12968VUW6lVE_db.jpeg","name":"Driftboat","tagline":"Driftboat"},{"id":11085,"slug":"harmony-grow","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"We are leading botanists using advanced robotic controlled environment agriculture to produce the purest, most consistent, and effective medical marijuana.","informationWebsite":"https://www.harmonydispensary.org/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/iCvg9hSTwewm56d2QueO_Harmony_Dispensary-logo.jpg","name":"Harmony Grow","tagline":"Harmony is NJ Medical Cannabis."},{"id":4677,"slug":"island","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Island is a lifestyle brand and cannabis company made for the Californian in you.

We started first to help patients get access to medical marijuana by opening one of the first medical clinics in WA.\n\nThen we built one of the first cooperative grows and retail dispensaries in the state.  Helping thousands of patients get safe access to medical marijuana.\n\nWorking with local patients, growers and dispensary owners, we established the C.C.S.E. to help bring about change within the cannabis community.  We helped develop the collective garden model and worked legislators to create and implement I502, Washington’s recreational marijuana law.\n\nThen we helped create Dope Magazine to inform the people and defend this amazing plant everywhere.\n\nFinally, once i502 passed we decided to create DawgStar Cannabis.

First Cut Farms is rooted in Covelo, in the Heart of the Emerald Triangle. Founder and Cultivator, Jerry Munn is a long-time, passionate cannabis activist with over 30 years of experience in cannabis cultivation and advocacy. His life's journey is dedicated to providing world-class cannabis to you. \n\nJerry has grown and cultivated indoor, outdoor and hydroponic gardens, from the cities to the mountains. His favorite style is outdoor, full-term, sun-grown, big trees. He enjoys nature and working in the elements. His love of cannabis is evident in his lifestyle and his daily schedule. He works with cannabis nearly every minute he's awake.  \n\nFirst Cut Farms is situated in Appellation Covelo which has a rich cultivation history. Covelo is an eco-system and micro-climate where cannabis plants thrive in the extreme temperature swings, the wind, rain, and Mendocino sunshine. Planting during the new moon, nutrient-rich, native soil and sparkling, pure, PH and alkaline balanced water help developing plants flourish and grow huge, strong, and frosty. That, plus organic inputs, eco-consciousness, regenerative farming methods, water conservation, composting, Grateful Dead playing to the plants, handcrafted farming, sacred seeds, and LOVE make First Cut Farms cannabis flowers unique and desired.  \n\nJerry creates sophisticated and complex cannabis cultivars. First Cut Farms is committed to producing new strains that have amazing flavors and effects. As a cannabis breeder, Jerry's developed proprietary strains that yield massive plants and dense buds with high oil production and potency. He creates high THC strains with unusual and full-flavored terps. Jerry breeds high-yielding seeds which ultimately contain the most distinctive and tastiest terps for the stoniest and most superb highs.\n\nAs a young adult, Jerry risked his freedom during the Aids crisis in the early 1990s, a time when medical treatment was unavailable to patients. He made certain HIV/Aids and cancer patients received their sacred medicine in a timely, dignified manner. If they were physically capable & interested, he taught them how to set up indoor gardens to grow and cultivate for themselves. Patients were never charged for his services. That is the spirit of cannabis. Jerry cultivated for & worked at the first Buyer's Club in San Francisco. His Mentor for almost 30 years was the legendary Dennis Peron, hero, to all cannabis patients and enthusiasts.  Dennis fought tirelessly for cannabis reform among many other successful crusades.  Dennis wrote Prop 215. \n\nJerry literally lived on a mountain under a log in Mendocino and grew cannabis for patients in need. Jerry's experience shows that cannabis cultivation requires extreme perseverance, dedication, physical strength, patience, and knowledge in farming, horticulture, biology, engineering, and social and political sciences.\n\nJerry is grateful and thankful for his mentors, friends, cultivators, cannabis lovers and the pioneers in his life, and the ones that gave their lives and freedom to bring cannabis to the people under all circumstances. First Cut Farms grows for everyone that cares about having high-quality cannabis. Friends of First Cut Farms, including fellow growers, savor the flavors and highs from this uncommon cannabis grown and bred in Covelo.\n\nFirst Cut Farms stands firmly in philanthropy. Recent memberships and sponsorships include Covelo Cannabis Advocacy Group, Mendocino Cannabis Alliance, the 1st Annual Bay Area Cannabis Pride Event, and Jerry Day 2019 in San Francisco bringing music to the people at no cost to the people.  First Cut Farms will continue to support important causes. \nContinuing education is provided for Jerry's First Cut Farms family. He an active member of the Covelo community. \n\nJerry's a small grower, operating purposefully, with no investors & no corporate influence.

Using innovative techniques ensures the quality of our product that is far superior to any competitive Medical Marijuana facility in Arizona. \n\nHow it began: Tierra Grow's majority owner was working on his own electrical business when his sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The medication she needed to control her pain was opiate-based and making her just as sick as the cancer itself. He knew several people who used Cannabis as a form of medicine to help with pain, nausea, and sleep. Although, he did not have considerable knowledge about how Cannabis was grown, he knew it may be what his sister needed. \n\nIn 2014 he started reaching out to several professionals and home growers; what he discovered was astonishing. As it turned out, many growers used non-organic, harmful pesticides on their crops. So, he took it upon himself to learn how to cultivate clean Cannabis.\n\nGoing through this experience and seeing the affects of opiate-based pain medication versus Cannabis was a turning point. He knew that if it helped his ailing sister, it could help others and he wanted to be a part of that. \nBy 2015 his vision came to fruition; to grow the best possible Cannabis on a large-scale to meet the needs of as many patients as possible. \n\n*Tierra Grow is an indoor 40,000sqft Facility. It is the supplier of top-quality cannabis to our sister companies Core Concentrates and Mockingbird Botanicals.

As demand for CBD-rich strains increased, a solution was needed to increase the availability without sacrificing the quality.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Giving Tree Farms began the process of implementing greenhouse environments.This greenhouse system enabled the more frequent sungrown crops using light-deprivation methods to increase the availability and consistency.\r\n\r\nWithout forgoing product quality, the light-dep process mimics the sungrown experience and allows a plant to flower in a time of year that it would not naturally - when cultivated using traditional sungrown methods. This process utilizes a retractable blackout curtain system to block the sunlight and also can be used to prevent light pollution. The breathable walls and cover are able to allow ventilation for full airflow passage, while the plants are in total darkness in the greenhouse. This innovative system allows crops to be in a vegetative and bloom phase year round. \r\n\r\nSuccession Planting\r\nGiving Tree Farms utilizes succession planting to ensure a consistent supply of flowers to take to market. In a traditional cultivation environment, a farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. Using a succession method allows Giving Tree Farms to have product ready to take to market every few months.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Impact\r\nWith the implications of climate change, water and energy consumption have become a serious concern for the cannabis industry. Giving Tree Farms has found the usage of the greenhouse coupled with a raised pallet for aeration and CocoTek mats for holding moisture significantly reduces the amount of water consumption compared to sungrown cultivation required to flower the same strains. \r\n\r\nInnovations in energy technology now give cultivators choices. With the advancements in solar power and LED-fitted lamps Giving Tree Farms has the opportunity to take control of their environmental footprint and are working towards reduce their consumption requirements. \r\n\r\nThese developments allow for products that rival sungrown and indoor quality without the energy consumption of a traditional indoor operation. Giving Tree Farms is diligently working to reduce their carbon footprint.","informationWebsite":"http://www.givingtreefarms.org/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/h6ZRexQyRcCIWLbM6BEo_Xv1a431x_400x400.jpg","name":"Giving Tree Farms","tagline":"Know Your Cannabis.

Using innovative techniques ensures the quality of our product that is far superior to any competitive Medical Marijuana facility in Arizona. \n\nHow it began: Tierra Grow's majority owner was working on his own electrical business when his sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The medication she needed to control her pain was opiate-based and making her just as sick as the cancer itself. He knew several people who used Cannabis as a form of medicine to help with pain, nausea, and sleep. Although, he did not have considerable knowledge about how Cannabis was grown, he knew it may be what his sister needed. \n\nIn 2014 he started reaching out to several professionals and home growers; what he discovered was astonishing. As it turned out, many growers used non-organic, harmful pesticides on their crops. So, he took it upon himself to learn how to cultivate clean Cannabis.\n\nGoing through this experience and seeing the affects of opiate-based pain medication versus Cannabis was a turning point. He knew that if it helped his ailing sister, it could help others and he wanted to be a part of that. \nBy 2015 his vision came to fruition; to grow the best possible Cannabis on a large-scale to meet the needs of as many patients as possible. \n\n*Tierra Grow is an indoor 40,000sqft Facility.

As demand for CBD-rich strains increased, a solution was needed to increase the availability without sacrificing the quality.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Giving Tree Farms began the process of implementing greenhouse environments.This greenhouse system enabled the more frequent sungrown crops using light-deprivation methods to increase the availability and consistency.\r\n\r\nWithout forgoing product quality, the light-dep process mimics the sungrown experience and allows a plant to flower in a time of year that it would not naturally - when cultivated using traditional sungrown methods. This process utilizes a retractable blackout curtain system to block the sunlight and also can be used to prevent light pollution. The breathable walls and cover are able to allow ventilation for full airflow passage, while the plants are in total darkness in the greenhouse. This innovative system allows crops to be in a vegetative and bloom phase year round. \r\n\r\nSuccession Planting\r\nGiving Tree Farms utilizes succession planting to ensure a consistent supply of flowers to take to market. In a traditional cultivation environment, a farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. Using a succession method allows Giving Tree Farms to have product ready to take to market every few months.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Impact\r\nWith the implications of climate change, water and energy consumption have become a serious concern for the cannabis industry. Giving Tree Farms has found the usage of the greenhouse coupled with a raised pallet for aeration and CocoTek mats for holding moisture significantly reduces the amount of water consumption compared to sungrown cultivation required to flower the same strains. \r\n\r\nInnovations in energy technology now give cultivators choices. With the advancements in solar power and LED-fitted lamps Giving Tree Farms has the opportunity to take control of their environmental footprint and are working towards reduce their consumption requirements. \r\n\r\nThese developments allow for products that rival sungrown and indoor quality without the energy consumption of a traditional indoor operation.

During the last 25 years we have developed a unique growing style that produces exceptionally healthy plants and remarkably resinous flowers, utilizing all natural and organic inputs. Our focus is on living soil, modeled closely on the processes we learn directly from nature.\nWe hold ourselves to the highest environmental standards, utilizing biodynamic principles and closed-loop systems, minimizing the carbon footprint of every plant that we grow. We strive to lead by example in the ever-expanding cannabis community, working to educate consumers and growers alike about the ecological benefits and superior quality potential of our sustainable grow model.\n\nThe secret to our Legendary Cultivation is our respect for the growing process as a perpetual cycle. We believe that the many symbiotic relationships within a healthy ecosystem create our renewed, naturally rich growing conditions.Our custom living soil recipe has been continually evolving through years of real world practice and experimentation. Our soil is forever improving with the passing of time, as every discarded part of the plant is returned to the soil for regeneration. Wildcrafting also serves as an integral piece of our regenerative mission.\n\nWe ferment and store all of our supplemental plant nutrients, which are directly sourced and gathered from our farm. With a little help from micro and macro biology, we are able to completely eliminate the need for bottled nutrients. This careful construction of our closed-loop system fuels the vigorous growth of our plants and forms one of the pillars of our “Legendary Cultivation” moniker.\n\nLarge or small, each and every plant is given individual, daily attention throughout its life cycle. Careful and constant observation is a major component to a plant’s healthy growth. In our commitment to deepen the level of individualized care, we avoid automation in exchange for the hand watering, sculpting, and inspecting of each plant based on its own unique needs. This keeps our team intimately connected with the garden as a whole and creates an endless stream of natural energy interchanging and strengthening the entire ecosystem. This time consuming and often costly process sets us far apart from the majority of automated, high-volume cannabis producers seen today, but in our opinion, it is only with such careful love and intent that superior, finished cannabis is grown.","informationWebsite":"https://gnomegrownorganics.com/our-farm/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/M67GNJmTGiMyfAmo5SfG_Gnome%20Grown_Logomark%20Vertical_Black-01.png","name":"Gnome Grown Organics","tagline":"Legendary Cultivation"},{"id":10063,"slug":"ripped-city-gardens","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Ripped City Gardens is dedicated to craft cannabis. \n\nFrom the time the clone is cut to the time it hits your lungs we take pride in the work we do to provide you with a great experience.

We observe sustainable farming practices, so our cannabis is grown the way nature intended; using locally sourced, organic soil amendments, mulches, and companion crops. These techniques allow us to dramatically reduce the amount of organic material and water consumed during the growth cycle.\n\nTo bolster our soil's dynamic food-web, we brew Active Aerated Compost Teas (AACT), and after a few days of steeping, we add this brew of probiotics to the soil. These microbes and fungi establish themselves in the earth, enhancing the plant's ability to assimilate the naturally occurring nutrients found in our mineral-rich soil. A living ecosystem develops around the roots, and a food-chain develops. At the top of this chain are worms, and their castings provide aeration, nitrogen and other nutrients which promote strong, healthy plants.\n\nIn addition to our sustainable, permaculture-based cultivation, we source phenotypes with complex terpene profiles. Terpenes are the smell & taste compounds found in all plant-life (click here for more about 'terps'), and are responsible for the \"entourage effect\" which give strains their unique. Another requisite for great tasting herb is a proper cure. Our buds are dried slowly, to insure maximum flavor and potency; so expect the room to be filled with a pungent aroma when you open a package of Lazy Bee cannabis. The latest research shows that terpenes play an integral roll in how each strain affects you. It is the combination of THC, additional cannabinoids, and the variety of terpenes which create the strain specific 'high' felt.\n \nWe are confident that you'll enjoy the experience of using our products.","informationWebsite":"http://lazybeegardens.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/P8ip3UaJQAOoQe3DLWFS_lazyb.png","name":"Lazy Bee Gardens","tagline":"Sustainably Sun Grown in the Methow Valley, WA"},{"id":4560,"slug":"sugar-leaf","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Sugarleaf was founded with a vision that we could one day being the best in the world at growing cannabis.

We observe sustainable farming practices, so our cannabis is grown the way nature intended; using locally sourced, organic soil amendments, mulches, and companion crops. These techniques allow us to dramatically reduce the amount of organic material and water consumed during the growth cycle.\n\nTo bolster our soil's dynamic food-web, we brew Active Aerated Compost Teas (AACT), and after a few days of steeping, we add this brew of probiotics to the soil. These microbes and fungi establish themselves in the earth, enhancing the plant's ability to assimilate the naturally occurring nutrients found in our mineral-rich soil. A living ecosystem develops around the roots, and a food-chain develops. At the top of this chain are worms, and their castings provide aeration, nitrogen and other nutrients which promote strong, healthy plants.\n\nIn addition to our sustainable, permaculture-based cultivation, we source phenotypes with complex terpene profiles. Terpenes are the smell & taste compounds found in all plant-life (click here for more about 'terps'), and are responsible for the \"entourage effect\" which give strains their unique. Another requisite for great tasting herb is a proper cure. Our buds are dried slowly, to insure maximum flavor and potency; so expect the room to be filled with a pungent aroma when you open a package of Lazy Bee cannabis. The latest research shows that terpenes play an integral roll in how each strain affects you. It is the combination of THC, additional cannabinoids, and the variety of terpenes which create the strain specific 'high' felt.\n \nWe are confident that you'll enjoy the experience of using our products.","informationWebsite":"http://lazybeegardens.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/P8ip3UaJQAOoQe3DLWFS_lazyb.png","name":"Lazy Bee Gardens","tagline":"Sustainably Sun Grown in the Methow Valley, WA"},{"id":12916,"slug":"nectar-farms","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"We are a premium small batch, boutique style grow specializing in exotic strains.","informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/x7N5SPmjTY2M3rKUhNKm_95582-AZNectar-SS.png","name":"AZ Nectar Farms","tagline":"The Connoisseurs Choice"},{"id":17240,"slug":"dr-strains-cbd","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Whether you’re looking for wholesale hemp or hemp flower for sale; Dr. Strains always provides our customers with unbeatable prices.

First Cut Farms is rooted in Covelo, in the Heart of the Emerald Triangle. Founder and Cultivator, Jerry Munn is a long-time, passionate cannabis activist with over 30 years of experience in cannabis cultivation and advocacy. His life's journey is dedicated to providing world-class cannabis to you. \n\nJerry has grown and cultivated indoor, outdoor and hydroponic gardens, from the cities to the mountains. His favorite style is outdoor, full-term, sun-grown, big trees. He enjoys nature and working in the elements. His love of cannabis is evident in his lifestyle and his daily schedule. He works with cannabis nearly every minute he's awake.  \n\nFirst Cut Farms is situated in Appellation Covelo which has a rich cultivation history. Covelo is an eco-system and micro-climate where cannabis plants thrive in the extreme temperature swings, the wind, rain, and Mendocino sunshine. Planting during the new moon, nutrient-rich, native soil and sparkling, pure, PH and alkaline balanced water help developing plants flourish and grow huge, strong, and frosty. That, plus organic inputs, eco-consciousness, regenerative farming methods, water conservation, composting, Grateful Dead playing to the plants, handcrafted farming, sacred seeds, and LOVE make First Cut Farms cannabis flowers unique and desired.  \n\nJerry creates sophisticated and complex cannabis cultivars. First Cut Farms is committed to producing new strains that have amazing flavors and effects. As a cannabis breeder, Jerry's developed proprietary strains that yield massive plants and dense buds with high oil production and potency. He creates high THC strains with unusual and full-flavored terps. Jerry breeds high-yielding seeds which ultimately contain the most distinctive and tastiest terps for the stoniest and most superb highs.\n\nAs a young adult, Jerry risked his freedom during the Aids crisis in the early 1990s, a time when medical treatment was unavailable to patients. He made certain HIV/Aids and cancer patients received their sacred medicine in a timely, dignified manner. If they were physically capable & interested, he taught them how to set up indoor gardens to grow and cultivate for themselves. Patients were never charged for his services. That is the spirit of cannabis. Jerry cultivated for & worked at the first Buyer's Club in San Francisco. His Mentor for almost 30 years was the legendary Dennis Peron, hero, to all cannabis patients and enthusiasts.  Dennis fought tirelessly for cannabis reform among many other successful crusades.  Dennis wrote Prop 215. \n\nJerry literally lived on a mountain under a log in Mendocino and grew cannabis for patients in need. Jerry's experience shows that cannabis cultivation requires extreme perseverance, dedication, physical strength, patience, and knowledge in farming, horticulture, biology, engineering, and social and political sciences.\n\nJerry is grateful and thankful for his mentors, friends, cultivators, cannabis lovers and the pioneers in his life, and the ones that gave their lives and freedom to bring cannabis to the people under all circumstances. First Cut Farms grows for everyone that cares about having high-quality cannabis. Friends of First Cut Farms, including fellow growers, savor the flavors and highs from this uncommon cannabis grown and bred in Covelo.\n\nFirst Cut Farms stands firmly in philanthropy. Recent memberships and sponsorships include Covelo Cannabis Advocacy Group, Mendocino Cannabis Alliance, the 1st Annual Bay Area Cannabis Pride Event, and Jerry Day 2019 in San Francisco bringing music to the people at no cost to the people.  First Cut Farms will continue to support important causes. \nContinuing education is provided for Jerry's First Cut Farms family. He an active member of the Covelo community. \n\nJerry's a small grower, operating purposefully, with no investors & no corporate influence.

His favorite style is outdoor, full-term, sun-grown, big trees. He enjoys nature and working in the elements. His love of cannabis is evident in his lifestyle and his daily schedule. He works with cannabis nearly every minute he's awake.  \n\nFirst Cut Farms is situated in Appellation Covelo which has a rich cultivation history. Covelo is an eco-system and micro-climate where cannabis plants thrive in the extreme temperature swings, the wind, rain, and Mendocino sunshine. Planting during the new moon, nutrient-rich, native soil and sparkling, pure, PH and alkaline balanced water help developing plants flourish and grow huge, strong, and frosty. That, plus organic inputs, eco-consciousness, regenerative farming methods, water conservation, composting, Grateful Dead playing to the plants, handcrafted farming, sacred seeds, and LOVE make First Cut Farms cannabis flowers unique and desired.  \n\nJerry creates sophisticated and complex cannabis cultivars. First Cut Farms is committed to producing new strains that have amazing flavors and effects. As a cannabis breeder, Jerry's developed proprietary strains that yield massive plants and dense buds with high oil production and potency. He creates high THC strains with unusual and full-flavored terps. Jerry breeds high-yielding seeds which ultimately contain the most distinctive and tastiest terps for the stoniest and most superb highs.\n\nAs a young adult, Jerry risked his freedom during the Aids crisis in the early 1990s, a time when medical treatment was unavailable to patients. He made certain HIV/Aids and cancer patients received their sacred medicine in a timely, dignified manner. If they were physically capable & interested, he taught them how to set up indoor gardens to grow and cultivate for themselves. Patients were never charged for his services. That is the spirit of cannabis. Jerry cultivated for & worked at the first Buyer's Club in San Francisco. His Mentor for almost 30 years was the legendary Dennis Peron, hero, to all cannabis patients and enthusiasts.  Dennis fought tirelessly for cannabis reform among many other successful crusades.  Dennis wrote Prop 215. \n\nJerry literally lived on a mountain under a log in Mendocino and grew cannabis for patients in need. Jerry's experience shows that cannabis cultivation requires extreme perseverance, dedication, physical strength, patience, and knowledge in farming, horticulture, biology, engineering, and social and political sciences.\n\nJerry is grateful and thankful for his mentors, friends, cultivators, cannabis lovers and the pioneers in his life, and the ones that gave their lives and freedom to bring cannabis to the people under all circumstances. First Cut Farms grows for everyone that cares about having high-quality cannabis. Friends of First Cut Farms, including fellow growers, savor the flavors and highs from this uncommon cannabis grown and bred in Covelo.\n\nFirst Cut Farms stands firmly in philanthropy. Recent memberships and sponsorships include Covelo Cannabis Advocacy Group, Mendocino Cannabis Alliance, the 1st Annual Bay Area Cannabis Pride Event, and Jerry Day 2019 in San Francisco bringing music to the people at no cost to the people.  First Cut Farms will continue to support important causes. \nContinuing education is provided for Jerry's First Cut Farms family. He an active member of the Covelo community. \n\nJerry's a small grower, operating purposefully, with no investors & no corporate influence.  First Cut Farms pledges to provide consistency and excellent individualized service. \n\nYour support of First Cut Farms validates the efforts of a man who is committed to delivering cannabis that will heal the world. It's his calling & life's journey.  Cannabis is the universal language of love. We consciously elevate vibrations as an intentional cannabis community. We're stronger together.

Our all-natural, sun grown techniques combine traditional and modern methods to produce connoisseur-grade Cannabis with minimal environmental impact.\n \nRespect for biological diversity and genetic integrity is at the heart of our work. Commercial production of Cannabis has reduced its range of desirable traits and effects. We’re dedicated to preserving the distinctive highs and unique character of great tropical and heirloom lineages. Our curated selection of rare strains includes nearly psychedelic African hazes, spiritual Central American landraces and cherished California “hippie” weeds.\n \n~ From our master grower’s notebook ~\nLegal psychoactive Cannabis allows for more than just recreational and medicinal use. Cannabis has an equally long, if not longer, history of use for divination, meditation, and magico-religious purposes, as an entheogen, as it does a narcotic. Even in western societies, as recent as the 1960s and 70s, Cannabis was part of the jazz, beat and psychedelic movements, used as a tool for introspection and expansion of consciousness. \n \nOver the last 30 years, we’ve seen a focus on Cannabis as more of a stupefacient and narcotic. This is not to say that devotees of traditional Cannabis haven’t been grumbling the entire time. Connoisseurs have been lamenting the loss of intellectually, and spiritually stimulating pot, in exchange for what was at first the infiltration of domestically grown indica, and what later became a genetically bottlenecked, poly-hybridized gene pool, high in THC, and possessing an dizzying array of flavors, but homogeneous in its ability to produce a bland, sedative effect, of limited utility to the artists, gifted academics, and spiritual sages who once embraced the species for its ability to enhance their intellectual and spiritual lives.","informationWebsite":"http://kionathc.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Kiona","tagline":"Tropical & Heirloom Cannabis"},{"id":5133,"slug":"dawg-star","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Dawg Star Cannabis started almost 10 years ago on a snowboard trip to Whistler BC, well at least the idea.

We started first to help patients get access to medical marijuana by opening one of the first medical clinics in WA.\n\nThen we built one of the first cooperative grows and retail dispensaries in the state.  Helping thousands of patients get safe access to medical marijuana.\n\nWorking with local patients, growers and dispensary owners, we established the C.C.S.E. to help bring about change within the cannabis community.

Browsing a wide range of strains that boast names like “Blunicorn” or “Sour Best Tangie” can be overwhelming and confusing to many consumers. With Perch Harvests we are looking to simplify this process by grouping similar strains in categories known as Perch Effects. \n\nEach Perch Effect has a unique component and all Perch flower grouped within that Perch Effect has been reported to provide a similar impact and potential benefit to the consumer. This allows for you to more easily narrow down your decision while feeling comfortable to explore beyond your usual strain. Perch Harvests aims to give the consumer a level of confidence in their selection while also making a conscious decision around their desired effects.\n\nHow are strains grouped into a Perch Effect?\n\nOur team has taken the time to deep-dive into the strains available from Perch Harvests to provide an educated decision on categorizing. Reviewing such important factors as lineage, reported effects, and consumer feedback provide a guiding light on selecting the Perch Effect each strain is grouped under. Our research doesn’t stop there, we include terpene results from a 3rd party laboratory to solidify our hypothesis on the interaction of each cannabis strain with the consumer.\n\nWhat are the 3 categories of Perch Effects?\n\nPerch Effect: Nest\nNest will contain strains known to have more relaxing and calming values. This is most notably the Indica-Dominant varietals often having higher amounts of the terpenes Linalool and Myrcene. These strains are popular for individuals yearning for a “couch-lock” sensation.\n\nPerch Effect: Hover\nHover will feature strains that have a good balance of relaxation and mood enhancement from their consumer’s reported effects. Containing a variety of hybrids, Hover is a great option for consumers not looking for a particular overarching effect and may want the flexibility to consume cannabis on their own schedule.\n\nPerch Effect: Fly\nFly is the final of the 3 Perch Effects, featuring strains known to be energizing and motivating for some individuals. Often having a higher proportion of Limonene, Humulene, and Pinene this effect will contain a majority of the Sativas in each harvest.","informationWebsite":"https://ma.temescalwellness.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":true,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/oLWpXSK8RYe5TKt1oStX_Weedmaps---Logo.png","name":"Perch Harvests","tagline":"Perch Harvests | Now Available at Temescal Wellness of MA"},{"id":11051,"slug":"arizona-organix","availableCountries":["Canada","United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"Arizona Organix opened our doors in 2012 and we are proud to be the state’s first licensed medical marijuana dispensary.\n\nSince then, we have managed to earn a place in the spotlight thanks to our incredible customer service and patient-centered approach.\n\nOur shop is known for its safe, clean environment supported by an experienced and knowledgeable staff.

Don't let the word laboratory fool you. Unlike warehouse grows we use old school techniques and small plant counts to give each plant the attention she deserves!\nAfter extensive flushing, we harvest at the peak of ripeness.  We vine-ripen and then hand trim the flower in our famous \"cannabis humidor\".  Once trimmed our flower spends at least 2 additional weeks in glass jars curing until it is delivered to your local dispensary.  We believe that this time consuming process gives the flower a better visual appearance, aroma, and keeps the valuable THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids intact.\n\nWe have been featured in Oregon Leaf https://issuu.com/nwleaf/docs/feb2020-oregonleaf  Pages 52-54\n\nWe are constantly pheno hunting new cultivars and consistently have genetics generally unavailable elsewhere in the state.

Founder and Cultivator, Jerry Munn is a long-time, passionate cannabis activist with over 30 years of experience in cannabis cultivation and advocacy. His life's journey is dedicated to providing world-class cannabis to you. \n\nJerry has grown and cultivated indoor, outdoor and hydroponic gardens, from the cities to the mountains. His favorite style is outdoor, full-term, sun-grown, big trees. He enjoys nature and working in the elements. His love of cannabis is evident in his lifestyle and his daily schedule. He works with cannabis nearly every minute he's awake.  \n\nFirst Cut Farms is situated in Appellation Covelo which has a rich cultivation history. Covelo is an eco-system and micro-climate where cannabis plants thrive in the extreme temperature swings, the wind, rain, and Mendocino sunshine. Planting during the new moon, nutrient-rich, native soil and sparkling, pure, PH and alkaline balanced water help developing plants flourish and grow huge, strong, and frosty. That, plus organic inputs, eco-consciousness, regenerative farming methods, water conservation, composting, Grateful Dead playing to the plants, handcrafted farming, sacred seeds, and LOVE make First Cut Farms cannabis flowers unique and desired.  \n\nJerry creates sophisticated and complex cannabis cultivars. First Cut Farms is committed to producing new strains that have amazing flavors and effects. As a cannabis breeder, Jerry's developed proprietary strains that yield massive plants and dense buds with high oil production and potency. He creates high THC strains with unusual and full-flavored terps. Jerry breeds high-yielding seeds which ultimately contain the most distinctive and tastiest terps for the stoniest and most superb highs.\n\nAs a young adult, Jerry risked his freedom during the Aids crisis in the early 1990s, a time when medical treatment was unavailable to patients. He made certain HIV/Aids and cancer patients received their sacred medicine in a timely, dignified manner. If they were physically capable & interested, he taught them how to set up indoor gardens to grow and cultivate for themselves. Patients were never charged for his services. That is the spirit of cannabis. Jerry cultivated for & worked at the first Buyer's Club in San Francisco. His Mentor for almost 30 years was the legendary Dennis Peron, hero, to all cannabis patients and enthusiasts.  Dennis fought tirelessly for cannabis reform among many other successful crusades.  Dennis wrote Prop 215. \n\nJerry literally lived on a mountain under a log in Mendocino and grew cannabis for patients in need. Jerry's experience shows that cannabis cultivation requires extreme perseverance, dedication, physical strength, patience, and knowledge in farming, horticulture, biology, engineering, and social and political sciences.\n\nJerry is grateful and thankful for his mentors, friends, cultivators, cannabis lovers and the pioneers in his life, and the ones that gave their lives and freedom to bring cannabis to the people under all circumstances. First Cut Farms grows for everyone that cares about having high-quality cannabis. Friends of First Cut Farms, including fellow growers, savor the flavors and highs from this uncommon cannabis grown and bred in Covelo.\n\nFirst Cut Farms stands firmly in philanthropy. Recent memberships and sponsorships include Covelo Cannabis Advocacy Group, Mendocino Cannabis Alliance, the 1st Annual Bay Area Cannabis Pride Event, and Jerry Day 2019 in San Francisco bringing music to the people at no cost to the people.  First Cut Farms will continue to support important causes. \nContinuing education is provided for Jerry's First Cut Farms family.

It’s an icon, a legend, an idea, a philosophy, and, to True Humboldt, it’s even a mission. We believe cannabis can play a healing role in a patient’s life. Physically. Emotionally. Environmentally. Even spiritually. That’s why we’ve dedicated ourselves to offering the best cannabis and services available anywhere.\n\nWhile we obsess about maintaining the world-renowned tradition of Humboldt’s superior quality, we also focused on breaking new ground in getting our excess medicine to patients that need it. By helping farmers and dispensaries smooth the reimbursement process, we’ve successfully developed a complete distribution network throughout the state.\n\nWe’re a growing network of farmers.\nWe’re run by a conscience, not a corporation. The founding members have lived in Humboldt for an average of 25 years. We raise our families in Humboldt, and we run our businesses throughout Humboldt County and in Arcata. We’re always interested in talking to like-minded farmers, so get in touch with us if you’d like to preserve the tradition of Humboldt quality and craft.\n\nWe work closely together.\nBy working together, we’re lowering the costs of production, establishing standards for superior consistency and quality control, competing in a competitive branded market, and preserving the heritage of Humboldt’s most notorious commodity.\n\nWe’re community-minded.\nWe’re not just a collective of farmers who share our accumulated knowledge and experience with each other. We also employ members of our community whenever possible and pay them living wages. We also work with local environmental engineers, lumber and construction companies, soil labs, nurseries, accountants, and more. Because we believe we’re all in it together.\n\nWe’re evolving.\nAlthough we’ve been around for a while, we know reform is on its way and that we need to adapt. This requires vision and the ability to thrive in a new environment. We’re already leading by example, too. We are seeking to fully permit our farms and are actively pursuing compliance with county regulatory agencies.\n\nWe’re craftsmen.\nSome craftsmen work with hammers and saws. We work with the earth, flowers, and sun. Each True Humboldt farmer is dedicated to carrying on the tradition of quality.","informationWebsite":"http://www.truehumboldt.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/prvsV5IdSWZClWe3a4AA","name":"True Humboldt","tagline":"Premium Sungrown Cannabis"},{"id":131,"slug":"yerba-buena","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Clean Green Certified & Certified Kind.

Consistency in flavor. Consistency in potency. Consistency in quality. And the only way to achieve unequalled consistency is to have complete control of your cannabis from seed to seal.\n\nIt starts with our Controlled-Environment Agriculture (CEA) approach. Our grow has been engineered to leave nothing in the growing process to chance and allow us to dial in temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light, nutrient concentration, and nutrient pH for each individual strain. A controlled environment also means nothing from the outside gets in and only the most potent cannabis is shipped out.\n\nWhat makes the Virginia Company cannabis so special is the way it’s grown: high-pressure aeroponics. To be clear, this is not hydroponics—it’s better. High-pressure aeroponics is a system whereby the roots, suspended in air, are saturated by a fine mist of water and nutrients. And because the roots are suspended, there’s zero soil and 100% oxygen and carbon dioxide reception. The result is flower achieving its genetic potential every single time. And as a bonus, high-pressure aeroponics uses 65% less water than hydroponics, so you can rest assured it’s environmentally friendly too.","informationWebsite":"https://www.thevirginia.co/welcome/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/eXku3JT3WkadjYNSXGMA_VirginiaCo_Logo_Stacked_C_TM.png","name":"Virginia Co.","tagline":"Old World Name.

The medication she needed to control her pain was opiate-based and making her just as sick as the cancer itself. He knew several people who used Cannabis as a form of medicine to help with pain, nausea, and sleep. Although, he did not have considerable knowledge about how Cannabis was grown, he knew it may be what his sister needed. \n\nIn 2014 he started reaching out to several professionals and home growers; what he discovered was astonishing. As it turned out, many growers used non-organic, harmful pesticides on their crops. So, he took it upon himself to learn how to cultivate clean Cannabis.\n\nGoing through this experience and seeing the affects of opiate-based pain medication versus Cannabis was a turning point. He knew that if it helped his ailing sister, it could help others and he wanted to be a part of that. \nBy 2015 his vision came to fruition; to grow the best possible Cannabis on a large-scale to meet the needs of as many patients as possible. \n\n*Tierra Grow is an indoor 40,000sqft Facility.

Using innovative techniques ensures the quality of our product that is far superior to any competitive Medical Marijuana facility in Arizona. \n\nHow it began: Tierra Grow's majority owner was working on his own electrical business when his sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The medication she needed to control her pain was opiate-based and making her just as sick as the cancer itself. He knew several people who used Cannabis as a form of medicine to help with pain, nausea, and sleep. Although, he did not have considerable knowledge about how Cannabis was grown, he knew it may be what his sister needed. \n\nIn 2014 he started reaching out to several professionals and home growers; what he discovered was astonishing. As it turned out, many growers used non-organic, harmful pesticides on their crops. So, he took it upon himself to learn how to cultivate clean Cannabis.\n\nGoing through this experience and seeing the affects of opiate-based pain medication versus Cannabis was a turning point. He knew that if it helped his ailing sister, it could help others and he wanted to be a part of that. \nBy 2015 his vision came to fruition; to grow the best possible Cannabis on a large-scale to meet the needs of as many patients as possible. \n\n*Tierra Grow is an indoor 40,000sqft Facility.

We share a love of land, ecology, and diversity. During the last 25 years we have developed a unique growing style that produces exceptionally healthy plants and remarkably resinous flowers, utilizing all natural and organic inputs. Our focus is on living soil, modeled closely on the processes we learn directly from nature.\nWe hold ourselves to the highest environmental standards, utilizing biodynamic principles and closed-loop systems, minimizing the carbon footprint of every plant that we grow. We strive to lead by example in the ever-expanding cannabis community, working to educate consumers and growers alike about the ecological benefits and superior quality potential of our sustainable grow model.\n\nThe secret to our Legendary Cultivation is our respect for the growing process as a perpetual cycle. We believe that the many symbiotic relationships within a healthy ecosystem create our renewed, naturally rich growing conditions.Our custom living soil recipe has been continually evolving through years of real world practice and experimentation. Our soil is forever improving with the passing of time, as every discarded part of the plant is returned to the soil for regeneration. Wildcrafting also serves as an integral piece of our regenerative mission.\n\nWe ferment and store all of our supplemental plant nutrients, which are directly sourced and gathered from our farm. With a little help from micro and macro biology, we are able to completely eliminate the need for bottled nutrients. This careful construction of our closed-loop system fuels the vigorous growth of our plants and forms one of the pillars of our “Legendary Cultivation” moniker.\n\nLarge or small, each and every plant is given individual, daily attention throughout its life cycle. Careful and constant observation is a major component to a plant’s healthy growth. In our commitment to deepen the level of individualized care, we avoid automation in exchange for the hand watering, sculpting, and inspecting of each plant based on its own unique needs. This keeps our team intimately connected with the garden as a whole and creates an endless stream of natural energy interchanging and strengthening the entire ecosystem. This time consuming and often costly process sets us far apart from the majority of automated, high-volume cannabis producers seen today, but in our opinion, it is only with such careful love and intent that superior, finished cannabis is grown.","informationWebsite":"https://gnomegrownorganics.com/our-farm/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/M67GNJmTGiMyfAmo5SfG_Gnome%20Grown_Logomark%20Vertical_Black-01.png","name":"Gnome Grown Organics","tagline":"Legendary Cultivation"},{"id":10854,"slug":"natures-heritage","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Nature's Heritage","informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Nature's Heritage","tagline":"Nature's Heritage"},{"id":13350,"slug":"strane","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"We’re all about the story of each strain, and the needs and tastes of each medical patient and adult-use enthusiast.

The founders and its team have a deep history of fostering the symbiotic relationship between cannabis as plant medicine, with creatives such as artists, designers and musicians.\n\nWonderbrett also built one of the largest cultivation facilities in North America.

The medication she needed to control her pain was opiate-based and making her just as sick as the cancer itself. He knew several people who used Cannabis as a form of medicine to help with pain, nausea, and sleep. Although, he did not have considerable knowledge about how Cannabis was grown, he knew it may be what his sister needed. \n\nIn 2014 he started reaching out to several professionals and home growers; what he discovered was astonishing. As it turned out, many growers used non-organic, harmful pesticides on their crops. So, he took it upon himself to learn how to cultivate clean Cannabis.\n\nGoing through this experience and seeing the affects of opiate-based pain medication versus Cannabis was a turning point. He knew that if it helped his ailing sister, it could help others and he wanted to be a part of that. \nBy 2015 his vision came to fruition; to grow the best possible Cannabis on a large-scale to meet the needs of as many patients as possible. \n\n*Tierra Grow is an indoor 40,000sqft Facility. It is the supplier of top-quality cannabis to our sister companies Core Concentrates and Mockingbird Botanicals. Providing us the ability to control the quality of medicine throughout all three companies.","informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/ex2hCB2VR46ADuTuGtKs_Tierra-Grow-Linkedin-Icon.jpg","name":"Tierra Grow","tagline":"Good principles, Great Cannabis"},{"id":13176,"slug":"hms-health-llc","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"HMS Health LLC","tagline":null},{"id":10566,"slug":"growhealthy","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"At GrowHealthy, we are dedicated to helping our patients live healthier, happier lives.

Browsing a wide range of strains that boast names like “Blunicorn” or “Sour Best Tangie” can be overwhelming and confusing to many consumers. With Perch Harvests we are looking to simplify this process by grouping similar strains in categories known as Perch Effects. \n\nEach Perch Effect has a unique component and all Perch flower grouped within that Perch Effect has been reported to provide a similar impact and potential benefit to the consumer. This allows for you to more easily narrow down your decision while feeling comfortable to explore beyond your usual strain. Perch Harvests aims to give the consumer a level of confidence in their selection while also making a conscious decision around their desired effects.\n\nHow are strains grouped into a Perch Effect?\n\nOur team has taken the time to deep-dive into the strains available from Perch Harvests to provide an educated decision on categorizing. Reviewing such important factors as lineage, reported effects, and consumer feedback provide a guiding light on selecting the Perch Effect each strain is grouped under. Our research doesn’t stop there, we include terpene results from a 3rd party laboratory to solidify our hypothesis on the interaction of each cannabis strain with the consumer.\n\nWhat are the 3 categories of Perch Effects?\n\nPerch Effect: Nest\nNest will contain strains known to have more relaxing and calming values. This is most notably the Indica-Dominant varietals often having higher amounts of the terpenes Linalool and Myrcene. These strains are popular for individuals yearning for a “couch-lock” sensation.\n\nPerch Effect: Hover\nHover will feature strains that have a good balance of relaxation and mood enhancement from their consumer’s reported effects. Containing a variety of hybrids, Hover is a great option for consumers not looking for a particular overarching effect and may want the flexibility to consume cannabis on their own schedule.\n\nPerch Effect: Fly\nFly is the final of the 3 Perch Effects, featuring strains known to be energizing and motivating for some individuals. Often having a higher proportion of Limonene, Humulene, and Pinene this effect will contain a majority of the Sativas in each harvest.","informationWebsite":"https://ma.temescalwellness.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":true,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/oLWpXSK8RYe5TKt1oStX_Weedmaps---Logo.png","name":"Perch Harvests","tagline":"Perch Harvests | Now Available at Temescal Wellness of MA"},{"id":12897,"slug":"firebrand-infusions","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":null,"informationWebsite":null,"isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://public.leafly.com/brands/brand-placeholder.svg","name":"Firebrand Infusions","tagline":null},{"id":13244,"slug":"old-pal","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Accessible, affordable, and abundant, Old Pal’s vision is simple: It’s just weed, y'all.

ForwardGro Medical Director, Dr. Deb Kimless, has been actively pursuing data through pro bono individualized treatments of patients suffering from a range of conditions including: epilepsy, arthritis, cancer and pain management. In states where medical cannabis is currently legal, she has assisted patients in developing tailored treatment plans using different methods of administration, and varying cannabinoid ratios to influence patient response. A specialist in the Endocannabinoid System (ECS), a signaling system that maintains physiological balance throughout the body, she’s demonstrated how cannabis treatments work with the ECS to treat pain and other medical conditions. Additional and ongoing research demonstrates the potential for cannabis-related treatments for disease and other medical conditions far beyond what is currently known. Dr Kimless is an internationally recognized speaker.\r\n\r\nForwardGro Patient Advocate, Gail Rand, who has a family member who suffers from epilepsy, became passionately involved in the Maryland legislature in 2013 as a parent advocate. She played an integral role in helping to pass the 2014 medical cannabis legislation in Maryland, as well as the 2015 legislation that further improved the program.

Our research doesn’t stop there, we include terpene results from a 3rd party laboratory to solidify our hypothesis on the interaction of each cannabis strain with the consumer.\n\nWhat are the 3 categories of Perch Effects?\n\nPerch Effect: Nest\nNest will contain strains known to have more relaxing and calming values. This is most notably the Indica-Dominant varietals often having higher amounts of the terpenes Linalool and Myrcene. These strains are popular for individuals yearning for a “couch-lock” sensation.\n\nPerch Effect: Hover\nHover will feature strains that have a good balance of relaxation and mood enhancement from their consumer’s reported effects. Containing a variety of hybrids, Hover is a great option for consumers not looking for a particular overarching effect and may want the flexibility to consume cannabis on their own schedule.\n\nPerch Effect: Fly\nFly is the final of the 3 Perch Effects, featuring strains known to be energizing and motivating for some individuals. Often having a higher proportion of Limonene, Humulene, and Pinene this effect will contain a majority of the Sativas in each harvest.","informationWebsite":"https://ma.temescalwellness.com/","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":true,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/oLWpXSK8RYe5TKt1oStX_Weedmaps---Logo.png","name":"Perch Harvests","tagline":"Perch Harvests | Now Available at Temescal Wellness of MA"},{"id":4424,"slug":"dicot-farms","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":false,"description":"Using all-organic cultivation methods, Dicot Farms is committed to providing the finest organically grown cannabis.","informationWebsite":"http://www.dicotfarms.com","isProductAffiliateLinksEnabled":false,"logo":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brands/logos/ZICaQQgSSmfANyvOZbfm_dicot%20logo.jpg","name":"Dicot Farms","tagline":"Superior Organically Grown Cannabis"},{"id":9555,"slug":"cannabis-nation","availableCountries":["United States"],"buyBoxEnabled":true,"claimed":true,"description":"What began as medical grow operation in Portland, Oregon, has emerged as a leader in Oregon's cannabis industry with a collection of dispensaries serving the Pacific Northwest.
