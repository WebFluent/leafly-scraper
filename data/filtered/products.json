A joint venture between Tierra Rojo and Paco, two Colorado based growers. The strain is a cross between LA Kush, an indica dominant hybrid known for its relaxing and euphoric properties, and Tang Tang, a racy sativa strain derived from a Blue Sonja backcross. The strain is prevalent in Colorado but can be difficult to find in other states. Pootie Tang won 3rd place at the 2015 Denver Cannabis Cup for best sativa flower.. Pootie Tang is best used when you want a pick me up. Pootie Tang may also increase appetite.\n\nPootie Tang can generally be described as earthy, hashy, and tangy. The smell is predominantly earthy, which is consistent with the aroma of each of the parents. The underlying tangy-ness is a mild citrus smell – like a fresh grapefruit as opposed to a ripe orange.  The taste can generally be described as dry, musty and slightly refreshing. The taste is predominantly earthy, which is consistent with both parents. The refreshing flavors can range from tangy (from the Tang Tang) to more piney (from the LA Kush). Despite the name, do not expect the flavor to be intensely ‘orange’.\n\nPootie Tang induces a strong head high with the classic frontal lobe sativa buzz. This strain can be somewhat of a ‘creeper’ with delayed effects that continue to increase in intensity over time. The LA Kush balances out the racy nature of the Tang Tang high. Overall, Pootie Tang induces a classic stoney sativa sensation that is concentrated in the head.\n","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/UNOyTHgcQrCZoXaaTtRP_pootie-tang-sugarleaf-jars.jpg","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Pooty Tang Flower","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-WA"],"photos":[{"id":49580,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/UNOyTHgcQrCZoXaaTtRP_pootie-tang-sugarleaf-jars.jpg","orderNumber":0},{"id":49581,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/gvw1LyMdToULON2xnqA6_Sugar Leaf_6269  Pootie Tang-edit.jpg","orderNumber":1},{"id":49582,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/6UDBt373RTmnoHlDM8FS_Sugar Leaf_6386 Pootie Tang-edit.jpg","orderNumber":2},{"id":49583,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/jUt65551SU2MyK7Jw5Xh_Sugar Leaf_6399 Pootie Tang-edit.jpg","orderNumber":3}],"shortDescription":"Tang Tang (sativa) x LA Kush (indica dom. hybrid).","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/UNOyTHgcQrCZoXaaTtRP_pootie-tang-sugarleaf-jars.jpg","videoUrl":null},{"id":226727,"slug":"archive-portland-dirty-taxi-flower","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Oregon"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":"0.14","cbdContentType":"percent","countApprovedPublicReviews":8,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.imgix.net/shared-web-images/product-type-icons/menu_flower_2.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Dirty Taxi","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-OR"],"photos":[],"shortDescription":"","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":"30.5","thcContentType":"percent","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":185836,"slug":"verano-g-purps-flower","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Illinois"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":8,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.imgix.net/shared-web-images/product-type-icons/menu_flower_1.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"G Purps","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-IL"],"photos":[],"shortDescription":"","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":"29.46","thcContentType":"percent","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":266565,"slug":"six-labs-tropicana-banana","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":"https://www.six-labs.com/product/tropicana-banana/","availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Michigan"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":4.875,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":8,"description":"Created by Harry Palms and Oni Seeds, Six Labs Tropicana Banana is a hybrid of this highly sought-after cookie strain crossed with the legendary clone-only Banana Kush, a strain celebrated for its tropical banana/fruit flavors.

It’s a striking strain, with deep and dark purple buds surrounded by bright orange hairs and a plethora of white trichomes. To say that Granddaddy Purple buds are stunning would be a gross understatement. There’s a reason why GDP has become one of the most famous purple colored cannabis strains in the United States, idolized for its vibrant shades and exotic candy-like aroma.\n\nIts parents are both indica strains: Purple Urkle and Big Bud. This strain is exceptionally similar to Grape Ape, and legend has it the two could be the same. However, it was first developed in 2003 by Ken Estes in California when he decided to create a new and remarkable indica using two strains that were already renowned for their effects. It’s best to consume this strain at night. It’s an excellent choice to aid sleep and ease tension in the body.

strain exudes interesting flavors and aromas. Upon taking a whiff of those explosive buds, you can detect hints of almond, cypress, cherry, and chocolate. TNT is an indica-dominant strain that has won several Cannabis Cups for its awesome characteristics. This plant has very narcotic and relaxing effects. Its small, round, dense, minty green nugs are popcorn-shaped and leafy with dark purple undertones. These nugs are caked in a thick, frosty layer of crystal trichomes and a thin layer of sweet and sticky resin. The TNT high is often described as a narcotic, full mind and body relaxation with moderate couch-lock and mild cases of the munchies. This lazy and sleepy high gives the user a high level of mind and body relief and often helps ease them into a deep and peaceful slumber. Due to these potent mind and body effects, TNT is ideal to treat patients who suffer from conditions such as chronic pain due to injury or illness, appetite loss, and tension or migraine headaches. The TNT buds have a sweet yet sour grapefruit aroma and a citrusy, earthy pine taste that sweetens upon exhale.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/nF1zymhCTpyVOi92xp5q_SIxLabs_Website_HomepageProductImage_TNT.png","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"TNT","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US"],"photos":[{"id":225064,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/nF1zymhCTpyVOi92xp5q_SIxLabs_Website_HomepageProductImage_TNT.png","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"TNT is an indica-dominant strain that has won several Cannabis Cups for its awesome characteristics.","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/nF1zymhCTpyVOi92xp5q_SIxLabs_Website_HomepageProductImage_TNT.png","videoUrl":null},{"id":283490,"slug":"livwell-flower-el-diablo-og-x-chem-dawg-4-flower","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":[],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":4.6,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":5,"description":"This indica dominant strain is a proprietary Kush hybrid that mixes the legendary El Diablo OG cut from the “Reseda Valley Caregivers” in the San Fernando Valley region of L.A. with the timeless classic Chem Dawg #4.

Grease Monkey also carries the sweet and musky flavor profile that will be familiar to fans of strains in the Girl Scout Cookies family. \n\nJust as it has many recreational uses, Grease Monkey also has a variety of applications for medical cannabis patients.

Its sedative properties can also soothe aches and pains of all kinds, whether temporary or chronic. Meanwhile, anti-inflammatory effects can be an effective treatment for everyday discomforts like nausea. In high enough doses, Grease Monkey can even counteract insomnia, lulling smokers into a deep and restful sleep.

Well loved by many for the fruity aroma and taste that is coupled with a rather mellow Indica style high. Quickly creeping in is a sense of euphoria that, while not often leading to couch-lock, will usually leave a user feeling a little lazy, perhaps even sleepy. This strain is great for relaxation as the other cerebral effects follow, uplifting users and making them feel happy. The body high that accompanies these effects is mild in comparison to some pure Indicas but still numbingly potent, as is Skywalker's munchies effect. Unfortunately this strain is not deprived of the usual negative effects; dry eyes and mouth, dizziness, paranoia and headaches. While not everyone feels dragged down to the depths of sleep by the use of Skywalker, responsible first-time users should leave this strain to evening or night time use. It is often the choice of medication for those who sufferer from stress, anxiety and insomnia. Skywalker is not recommended for severe or intense pain but may lessen the effects of milder aches and pains. The strain is also used to induce appetite, fight depression and alleviate nausea. Skywalker is bred by Dutch Passion, being a cross between a Mazar and a Blueberry. This strain is relatively easy to grow and can be grown by new growers. Flowering for between eight and nine weeks; this strain should be grown indoors. If grown in the most optimal conditions, plants may yield up to 400 grams per square meter.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leaflogixmedia.blob.core.windows.net/product-image/bf7826f5-20aa-4641-925e-cb382003a552.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Skywalker Kush","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AR"],"photos":[{"id":154588,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leaflogixmedia.blob.core.windows.net/product-image/bf7826f5-20aa-4641-925e-cb382003a552.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":"19.4","thcContentType":"percent","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":183778,"slug":"kelso-kreeper-kelso-kreeper-flower","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":3,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":4,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.imgix.net/shared-web-images/product-type-icons/menu_flower_1.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Kelso Kreeper","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-WA"],"photos":[],"shortDescription":"","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":"0","thcContentType":"none","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":272646,"slug":"kind-tree-rum-runner","affiliateLinkText":"Buy Here","affiliateLinkUrl":"https://kindtreecannabis.com/nj-strains/","availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["New Jersey"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":3.666666666666667,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":3,"description":"Rum Runner was bred with the two popular strains Purple Punch and Triangle Kush.

In the 1960’s travelling hippies and surfers from all over Australia convened to the city of Nimbin, creating the country’s counterculture mecca. With seeds found in imported flowers from Thailand and Papua New Guinea, and thanks to the humid subtropical climate of northeastern New South Wales, the locals developed the most legendary Cannabis ever to grow under the Australian sun, the Mullumbimby Madness. Named for its potent, highly cerebral effect, this highly sought after Australian heirloom has fallen to near extinction, giving way to modern cultivars. Simultaneously, in North America, many in the counterculture decided to follow Timothy Leary to Oaxaca, and participate in the ancient psilocybin using Curandero culture. This same culture in the mountains of Oaxaca, also grew a similarly benevolent yet psychedelic variety of Cannabis, known as the Highland Oaxaca Gold.\n\n \n\nThe marriage of these two rare long flowering tropicals results in flowers that never disappoints. Not lacking for sheer potency, and ability to go toe to toe in both ceiling and hit for hit potency against any contemporary variety, the flowers produce a delightful and positive, and highly energizing in their effect. The flavor and nose are sweet, herbaceous and floral, mostly leaning towards the South Pacific ancestry of the Mullumbimby Madness. This is not to be missed. As with many of our pure tropicals, they are rare anywhere in the world, but especially rare in Washington, since they don’t express their best potential indoors, yet their late trigger into flowering and extended flowering period make them incompatible with the latitude and climate of Washington state. It is only through a concerted effort, dedicated to the production real heirloom tropical Cannabis available that we’re able to make these available.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/products/photos/dYtUa0HRvu4ONJVszNMQ_canguru-oaxaca-kiona.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Canguru de Oaxaca","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-WA"],"photos":[{"id":140992,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/products/photos/dYtUa0HRvu4ONJVszNMQ_canguru-oaxaca-kiona.png","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":null,"subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":49006,"slug":"ayra-purple-pineapple-express","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":"%","countApprovedPublicReviews":2,"description":"Trainwreck X Hawaiian X Huckleberry Hound\nIndica Dominant Hybrid - 60% | 40% \nTerpene Total – 7.15%\nProminent Terpenes - a-Terpineol, b-Caryophyllene, Linalool, P-Cymene\n\nPurple Pineapple Express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strains Trainwreck and Hawaiian with Huckleberry Hound. \n\nFlavors\nPurple Pineapple’s trichome packed buds have a rich fusion of tropical fruits, coffee, and pine aromas. \n\nEffects\nPurple Pineapple Express is a powerful indica dominant variety that provides airy body effects that take on more weight with time and cerebral effects that remind many of a Sour Diesel type of mental stimuli. \n\nPerfect For\nPurple Pineapple is just what the Indica lover has been searching for.

In the 1960’s travelling hippies and surfers from all over Australia convened to the city of Nimbin, creating the country’s counterculture mecca. With seeds found in imported flowers from Thailand and Papua New Guinea, and thanks to the humid subtropical climate of northeastern New South Wales, the locals developed the most legendary Cannabis ever to grow under the Australian sun, the Mullumbimby Madness. Named for its potent, highly cerebral effect, this highly sought after Australian heirloom has fallen to near extinction, giving way to modern cultivars. Simultaneously, in North America, many in the counterculture decided to follow Timothy Leary to Oaxaca, and participate in the ancient psilocybin using Curandero culture. This same culture in the mountains of Oaxaca, also grew a similarly benevolent yet psychedelic variety of Cannabis, known as the Highland Oaxaca Gold.\n\n \n\nThe marriage of these two rare long flowering tropicals results in flowers that never disappoints. Not lacking for sheer potency, and ability to go toe to toe in both ceiling and hit for hit potency against any contemporary variety, the flowers produce a delightful and positive, and highly energizing in their effect. The flavor and nose are sweet, herbaceous and floral, mostly leaning towards the South Pacific ancestry of the Mullumbimby Madness. This is not to be missed. As with many of our pure tropicals, they are rare anywhere in the world, but especially rare in Washington, since they don’t express their best potential indoors, yet their late trigger into flowering and extended flowering period make them incompatible with the latitude and climate of Washington state.

The final product is a dense purple-green strain with all of the essential traits of Thin Mint. Kush Cookies is a masterful cross, and we highly recommend giving it a try.

Possessed of a more buoyant head than typically found in body focused-CBD strains, Astral Works brings gentle focus and calming clarity to the daily flow of duty and distraction. \n\nPrimary terpene: Myrcene 8.93-10.93\nSecondary terpene: Terpinolene 5.53-8.07 mg/g\nTHC: 5.6-6.5% | CBD: 9.6-10.8%\nFlavors: Floral, Mango, Herbal\nEffects: Soothing, Relaxation, Uplifting\n\nReview:\n\"From the farms of Prūf Cultivar comes Astral Works, the epitome of innovation in cannabis pharmacology. Drawing on the rich legacy and hybridization efforts of the late Lawrence Ringo of SoHum Seeds, Astral Works is a next-generation ‘Type 2’ (mixed ratio of CBD:THC) plant. It features a rare terpinolene-dominant nose, which adds a smoky flavor to subtle notes of dank mango. Deep purple anthocyanin (a natural compound that gives the sample its purple color, and acts as a natural anti-inflammatory, antiviral and cancer fighter) blooms from within the matrix. The effects are mellow, but according to Prūf Cultivar, this strain is high in CBDV, with small THCV and CBG peaks in a fully mature plant, creating an uplifting, relaxing smoking experience. I’d love to offer this to someone suffering from anxiety, PTSD, or who just wants ease their tension without getting blasted. Michael Lobdell, Prūf’s propagation manager, personally believes it’s vital to keep your consumption dynamic and avoid reliance on the most common chemotypes available. I hope everyone is able to try this exclusive cultivar from Prūf!\" – DOPE Magazine - Oregon - The DOPEST Issue - January 2018","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/v0AK7s9bTd2X84PwyV6z_AstralWorks_Leafly-V2.jpg","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Astral Works","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-OR"],"photos":[{"id":25966,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/v0AK7s9bTd2X84PwyV6z_AstralWorks_Leafly-V2.jpg","orderNumber":6},{"id":25979,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/PexvYi5RdKwqNb0wOKVQ_AW-1103-6185.jpg","orderNumber":7},{"id":25976,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/wg522nFyQZetCYxIRcod_AW-1103-6222.jpg","orderNumber":8},{"id":25973,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/UZscgVgvSxCMZ8L5clkG_AW-1103-6231.jpg","orderNumber":9},{"id":25986,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/FHsXW9tORE6CjfFZlG2e_AW-1103-6277.jpg","orderNumber":10}],"shortDescription":"Astral Works brings gentle focus and calming clarity to the daily flow of duty and distraction.

The strain has been in known existence for over 60 years and maintains a lofty reputation of quality and potency.  Gracing the 1965 edition of the English Oxford Dictionary and finding fame among popular musicians and culture the strain has endured the test of time.  Also making High Times top 25 best strains of all time, we are proud to grow this South American legend.\nThe strain is an impressive yielder both indoor and out.  Potency for the strain has rated 20% + long before today’s soil medium and nutrient advances.

Cerebral effect is pronounced, with a hazy and uplifting trip into the clouds that is mentally active, but not overly intoxicating. Physical effects are more mild, limited to a serene and pleasant body high that is not sedating.

Mile 62 strains are always hand trimmed, and grower selected for their intense flavors, aromas, high TAC and terpene content. Given the higher cost associated with producing these strains; including more production runs for pheno-hunting, additional nutrients, time of hand trimming, and overall top-notch quality and testing, Mile 62 strains will command a higher price relative to other flower in-store.\n\nStrain Type: Sativa Dominant (30I/70S) | Genetics: African Orange x Super Sour Diesel\n\nSuper Sour Orange is a sweet sativa dominant cultivar that carries pungent aromas of musky orange and sour citrus. Awakening and motivating effects are drawn through from its Super Sour Diesel mother, making it a great strain for daytime use or socializing, patients report. This cultivar is also reported to be uplifting and inspiring, often fostering a safe space for creativity and euphoria.

Said to be developed by a Buddhist monk named Perry in Big Sur, CA during the early 1960’s from Mexican and Afghan imports. It is the oldest known indica sativa hybrid from America. Our Big Sur Hippie weed, known in some California circles as the DS, goes back equally far but is the Holyweed backcrossed to its Afghan parent.

The flower structure is\nlacking in hairs displaying calyx with a rich shade of green.\n\nThe father was selected from SSSC [Super Sativa Seed Club] Vault\nWilliams Wonder seeds sent privately to Washington State from Spain.\nThis famous pure Indica is rare to find in genuine genetic form and\nprovides the fruity notes hidden in the cross. The mother was a Legacy\nSkunk Cheese Sativa homogenized by a guerilla grower over several\ndecades in the Willapa Bay area of Washington State. This is a true\nhybrid of two pure bloodlines – Sativa and Indica – Coming together to\ncreate a plant with amazing structure, fast flowering time, robust\nimmunity, capable of finishing in the short NW outdoor season and\nperforming indoors for the rest of the year. It performs above\nexpectation in a greenhouse environment.\n\nThe effects start with a euphoric uplifting body high. A sense of\nwarmth takes over as the sensation moves its way up your jaw, cheeks,\nface, and head. This is followed by a steady climb towards a\npsychoactive peak that numbs anxiety while encouraging introspection.\nThis strain is notably an aphrodisiac for both partners. Users report\nthat it is their most beloved strain to enjoy with a glass of wine. It\nis a well-rounded sensation, a potent experience, and the effects are\nlong lasting. The high ends more cerebral than it began and finishes\ninto the vapor leaving one feeling refreshed and centered. Relaxing\nyet awake.\n\nMedically, patients experience strong pain relief, a great suppression\nof nausea, lowered anxiety, and increased blood flow. A relaxation of\nthe muscles helps with cramps and tissue pain. This strain is reported\nto be neutral in appetite response with some users reporting appetite\nsuppression. Patients that suffer from sexual dysfunctions will find\nthis plant very therapeutic and aiding. Those with nerve pain, joint\npain, and especially back pain will find this plant a good strain to\nget them through the day. People with Anxiety, PTSD, and ADD will find\nthis strain rewarding - a missing link that allows energy while\ncalming the mental spaces.\n\nWillie Cheesie was bred by David McDowell with the assistance of an\nunnamed breeder in the Willapa Bay area of Washington State while\nDavid was growing at a small medical dispensary on the Port of\nRaymond. David McDowell is the Master Grower and Co-Founder of Nerdie\nBirdie Farms in Port Townsend Washington. The name \"Willie Cheesie\" is\na pun of 'really cheesy' while referencing the Williams in the cross -\nspelled with I's and E's in honor of the farms spelling of \"Nerdie\nBirdie.\" In-house this plant is called \"Ras Ible\" after the activist\nand friend. The flower can be found under the brand name \"Local\" and \"Nerdie Birdie\" in \nWestern Washington.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/pAW1RUDTT3qHAio7bAGa_WC 3.jpg","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Willie Cheesie","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-WA"],"photos":[{"id":37406,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/pAW1RUDTT3qHAio7bAGa_WC 3.jpg","orderNumber":1}],"shortDescription":"Euphoria, happiness, elevated body high.

Normally this is achieved by hang drying the product for several months, but by freezing the product immediately after harvest, the buds are preserved exactly how they were on the plant. This means less terpene content is lost while the product is being cured, it also means a longer shelf life and better shelf appeal.

With subtle notes of peach and cinnamon, this hoppy and relaxing strain will chill you to the max.\n\nOur Chardonnay CBD hemp flower contains moderate levels of Bisabolol, Caryophyllene, Guaiol and Myrcene, making for a subtle and refined experience. These sativa-dominant buds contain just the right levels of CBD and CBDA with a sparse volume of Humulene to give them that extra relieving touch.\n\nHumulene is often used in the manufacture of craft beer and you’ll see why when you burn these buds. All of our Chardonnay nugs are dense, fuzzy and engineered for pure elation. Industrial Hemp Farms specializes in pesticide-free, genetically superior strains that will make your mouth water and your heart happy.\n\nThis one is simply too special to pass up. Pungent, skunky and citrusy, our Chardonnay CBD hemp flower is overwhelmingly aromatic without being overwhelming to the body or mind. Bigger and bolder than almost any other buds you’re likely to come across, Chardonnay will fill your home with a warm and inviting scent that will keep you blissful and bemused.\n\nChardonnay pairs nicely with our Cherry Wine CBD hemp flower for a fruity treat that’s bold and sweet. Try them today and tell us all about your good time. We welcome consumer feedback and pride ourselves on customer satisfaction.\n\nAll chemicals are properly analyzed and approved prior to distribution. Our CBD hemp flowers have been found to be below 0.3% THC before harvest. Precise concentrations may vary from strain to strain. This product is Farm Bill compliant and comes with proper legal certification.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/qlmuQCMQBWoaf05hE47t_Chardonnay-CBD-Hemp.jpg","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Chardonnay Hemp Flower","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US"],"photos":[{"id":62724,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/qlmuQCMQBWoaf05hE47t_Chardonnay-CBD-Hemp.jpg","orderNumber":0},{"id":62725,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/ufE7hCraT3SEioZ3WjBm_Buy Chardonnay Hemp Flower.jpg","orderNumber":1}],"shortDescription":"Our Chardonnay CBD hemp flower contains moderate levels of Bisabolol, Caryophyllene, Guaiol and Myrcene, making for a subtle and refined experience.","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/qlmuQCMQBWoaf05hE47t_Chardonnay-CBD-Hemp.jpg","videoUrl":null},{"id":244242,"slug":"hotboxedcom-russian-cream-flower","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["California"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":"0.04","cbdContentType":"percent","countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/sZhmJqXTRK2SGZVpaXe7_hot box.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Russian Cream","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-CA"],"photos":[{"id":173683,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/sZhmJqXTRK2SGZVpaXe7_hot box.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":"18.53","thcContentType":"percent","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":39182,"slug":"artisan-grown-blackberry-fire","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Oregon"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"The buds are incredibly dense and absolutely covered in trichomes.

The flower structure is\nlacking in hairs displaying calyx with a rich shade of green.\n\nThe father was selected from SSSC [Super Sativa Seed Club] Vault\nWilliams Wonder seeds sent privately to Washington State from Spain.\nThis famous pure Indica is rare to find in genuine genetic form and\nprovides the fruity notes hidden in the cross. The mother was a Legacy\nSkunk Cheese Sativa homogenized by a guerilla grower over several\ndecades in the Willapa Bay area of Washington State. This is a true\nhybrid of two pure bloodlines – Sativa and Indica – Coming together to\ncreate a plant with amazing structure, fast flowering time, robust\nimmunity, capable of finishing in the short NW outdoor season and\nperforming indoors for the rest of the year. It performs above\nexpectation in a greenhouse environment.\n\nThe effects start with a euphoric uplifting body high. A sense of\nwarmth takes over as the sensation moves its way up your jaw, cheeks,\nface, and head. This is followed by a steady climb towards a\npsychoactive peak that numbs anxiety while encouraging introspection.\nThis strain is notably an aphrodisiac for both partners. Users report\nthat it is their most beloved strain to enjoy with a glass of wine. It\nis a well-rounded sensation, a potent experience, and the effects are\nlong lasting. The high ends more cerebral than it began and finishes\ninto the vapor leaving one feeling refreshed and centered. Relaxing\nyet awake.\n\nMedically, patients experience strong pain relief, a great suppression\nof nausea, lowered anxiety, and increased blood flow. A relaxation of\nthe muscles helps with cramps and tissue pain. This strain is reported\nto be neutral in appetite response with some users reporting appetite\nsuppression. Patients that suffer from sexual dysfunctions will find\nthis plant very therapeutic and aiding. Those with nerve pain, joint\npain, and especially back pain will find this plant a good strain to\nget them through the day. People with Anxiety, PTSD, and ADD will find\nthis strain rewarding - a missing link that allows energy while\ncalming the mental spaces.\n\nWillie Cheesie was bred by David McDowell with the assistance of an\nunnamed breeder in the Willapa Bay area of Washington State while\nDavid was growing at a small medical dispensary on the Port of\nRaymond.

meets new in this special hybrid bred by Coastal Seeds out of Santa Cruz. As the name suggests, a late 70s-era Hawaiian “Puna Budder” sativa from the Big Island was crossed with the popular Girl Scout Cookies cut, renowned for its empowered calm. The result is an overall uplifting experience that dulcifies the body while invigorating the senses. This variety shares some of the more desirable traits with our Ol’ Mendo Hashplant but with a more sativa-leaning structure and effect. It produces flowers with purple highlights and a lemon funk fuel odor that carries well into its flavor. While the effect is fairly physical, Puna Butter Cookies offers a notably positive, clear

Low doses are conducive to concentration and creativity, but some users may notice some cerebral haziness as you administer more. Its indica properties make Don's Ghost an ideal choice for pain relief and insomnia, though its potency may bring on more sativa-like energetic effects for some

from a family in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Mountains along the Caribbean coast, these heirloom crops are watered entirely by hand and grown using sustainable, noncommercial methods. These high-quality plants are derived from two lines, including an ancestral Colombian Highland Gold strain which reflects the traits of the original Santa Marta Golds that pre-date Colombia’s export market. The other line, simply referred to as La Mota, central American Spanish for “The Flower”. It is a selection made for magico-religious purposes by Arhuaco healers from a miniscule and extremely desirable portion of wild plants that existed in the region many generations ago. This population is thought to be ancestral to the vast majority of the Caribbean, Central and South American drug cultivars. The pure purple and purple gold types exhibit traits that lean heavily toward The Mota, and are a significant departure from the export-grade Cannabis produced by Colombia from 1972 to present day.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/products/photos/y1JFL5EgTVCV9vlFQE9u_santa-marta-purple-kiona.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Santa Marta Purple","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-WA"],"photos":[{"id":134287,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/products/photos/y1JFL5EgTVCV9vlFQE9u_santa-marta-purple-kiona.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":null,"subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":233285,"slug":"ace-revolution-royal-wedding-flower","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Illinois","Arkansas"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"Bred for its consistent relaxing effects, vanilla-lavender cake flavoring and trichome-rich nugs that sparkle through hues of silver and purple.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/A1Va6JDkQ2ao5LVlYLvj_Royal Wedding.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Royal Wedding","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-IL","US-AR"],"photos":[{"id":198139,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/A1Va6JDkQ2ao5LVlYLvj_Royal Wedding.jpg","orderNumber":1}],"shortDescription":"4 Kings x Wedding Crasher #41","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":"23.4","thcContentType":"percent","thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/A1Va6JDkQ2ao5LVlYLvj_Royal Wedding.jpg","videoUrl":null},{"id":34951,"slug":"og-zonka-zonka-granddaddy-purple","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Arizona"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":null,"hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/BiTZ2VjaR6GNAr8sBdWS_3A1DD699-044E-4952-93B4-CDC0B729E2F3.jpeg","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Zonka Granddaddy Purple ","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-AZ"],"photos":[{"id":53813,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/BiTZ2VjaR6GNAr8sBdWS_3A1DD699-044E-4952-93B4-CDC0B729E2F3.jpeg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"Granddaddy Purp by Zonka Farms ","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/BiTZ2VjaR6GNAr8sBdWS_3A1DD699-044E-4952-93B4-CDC0B729E2F3.jpeg","videoUrl":null},{"id":226408,"slug":"cannakings-marilyn-monroe-og-flower","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["California"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":"0.04","cbdContentType":"percent","countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/3oCl0S1tRbSnIyB5geY8_image.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Marilyn Monroe OG","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-CA"],"photos":[{"id":156745,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/menu/3oCl0S1tRbSnIyB5geY8_image.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":"23.45","thcContentType":"percent","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":30145,"slug":"aroma-banana-split","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Oregon"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"Bred by Crockett Farms, Banana Split is a sativa-dominant cross of their famous Tangie and Banana Sherbert.

yourself a full bowl of yum with Chardonnay, an elegant strain with a stunning bouquet and even more stunning effects. With subtle notes of peach and cinnamon, this hoppy and relaxing strain will chill you to the max.\n\nOur Chardonnay CBD hemp flower contains moderate levels of Bisabolol, Caryophyllene, Guaiol and Myrcene, making for a subtle and refined experience. These sativa-dominant buds contain just the right levels of CBD and CBDA with a sparse volume of Humulene to give them that extra relieving touch.\n\nHumulene is often used in the manufacture of craft beer and you’ll see why when you burn these buds. All of our Chardonnay nugs are dense, fuzzy and engineered for pure elation. Industrial Hemp Farms specializes in pesticide-free, genetically superior strains that will make your mouth water and your heart happy.\n\nThis one is simply too special to pass up. Pungent, skunky and citrusy, our Chardonnay CBD hemp flower is overwhelmingly aromatic without being overwhelming to the body or mind. Bigger and bolder than almost any other buds you’re likely to come across, Chardonnay will fill your home with a warm and inviting scent that will keep you blissful and bemused.\n\nChardonnay pairs nicely with our Cherry Wine CBD hemp flower for a fruity treat that’s bold and sweet. Try them today and tell us all about your good time. We welcome consumer feedback and pride ourselves on customer satisfaction.\n\nAll chemicals are properly analyzed and approved prior to distribution. Our CBD hemp flowers have been found to be below 0.3% THC before harvest. Precise concentrations may vary from strain to strain. This product is Farm Bill compliant and comes with proper legal certification.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/qlmuQCMQBWoaf05hE47t_Chardonnay-CBD-Hemp.jpg","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Chardonnay Hemp Flower","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US"],"photos":[{"id":62724,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/qlmuQCMQBWoaf05hE47t_Chardonnay-CBD-Hemp.jpg","orderNumber":0},{"id":62725,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/ufE7hCraT3SEioZ3WjBm_Buy Chardonnay Hemp Flower.jpg","orderNumber":1}],"shortDescription":"Our Chardonnay CBD hemp flower contains moderate levels of Bisabolol, Caryophyllene, Guaiol and Myrcene, making for a subtle and refined experience.","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/qlmuQCMQBWoaf05hE47t_Chardonnay-CBD-Hemp.jpg","videoUrl":null},{"id":16117,"slug":"sugar-leaf-agent-orange","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"Don’t let the name scare you!

This strain highlights the work of multiple highly talented breeders based out of San Francisco and LA County. Gelato, one of the parents for Gushers, was created by Sherbinski by hybridizing Sunset Sherbet (Pink Panties x GSC (f.k.a. Girl Scout Cookies)) and Thin Mint GSC. The result was a strain that has given us many legendary cuts including Gelato 33 (Larry Bird) and Gelato 44, the parent of Gushers.\n\nThe other parent is the legendary TK, also known as Triangle Kush, a strain that is widely accepted to be the origin point for all OG Kush strains grown today. This Indica-Dominant hybrid’s aroma is a wonderful blend of sweet and slightly sour tropical fruits, with fresh, earthy herbal tones. Initially the Gusher high is very invigorating, then it’s sedating. This creates a beautiful combination of both euphoric cerebral high followed by a wave of full mind and body relaxation. This high makes Gushers perfect to lift your spirit during the day or counteract anxiety while relaxing the muscles. It will also allow your mind to unwind and wander freely at night.","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/qNVlys4DQFmmnNNezcaW_Gusher.png","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Gusher","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-MI"],"photos":[{"id":191288,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/qNVlys4DQFmmnNNezcaW_Gusher.png","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"This strain originates from within the Cookie Fam camp, which owns the very popular cannabis brand, Cookies.","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":null,"thcContentType":null,"thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/qNVlys4DQFmmnNNezcaW_Gusher.png","videoUrl":null},{"id":194412,"slug":"ember-valley-northern-fire-flower","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["California"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":"0","cbdContentType":"none","countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/products/photos/aAQXT6AnQ2Caf0BbABr3_jJXHpaVcQKCqHQSOFHoC_c44d69_0eea58f401ca450890f9bc732a30767b_mv2.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Northern Fire","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-CA"],"photos":[{"id":115229,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leafly-images/products/photos/aAQXT6AnQ2Caf0BbABr3_jJXHpaVcQKCqHQSOFHoC_c44d69_0eea58f401ca450890f9bc732a30767b_mv2.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":"0","thcContentType":"none","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":190744,"slug":"gorilla-gardens-sugar-mill-flower","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Oklahoma"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":"0.04","cbdContentType":"percent","countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.imgix.net/shared-web-images/product-type-icons/menu_flower_1.png","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":null,"name":"Sugar Mill","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-OK"],"photos":[],"shortDescription":"","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":"24","thcContentType":"percent","thumbnailImageUrl":null,"videoUrl":null},{"id":224517,"slug":"top-shelf-washington-samoas-flower","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":["Washington"],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":"0.06","cbdContentType":"percent","countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/YQencUYzTXIcrqjg2ON9_4g.jpg","isAvailable":true,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":0,"name":"Shaved Monkey ","normalizedGeographicAvailability":["US-WA"],"photos":[{"id":196514,"caption":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/YQencUYzTXIcrqjg2ON9_4g.jpg","orderNumber":0}],"shortDescription":"4g","subcategoryName":"Flower","subcategorySlug":"flower","thcContent":"32.8","thcContentType":"percent","thumbnailImageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/YQencUYzTXIcrqjg2ON9_4g.jpg","videoUrl":null},{"id":36295,"slug":"natures-grace-and-wellness-lemon-skunk","affiliateLinkText":null,"affiliateLinkUrl":null,"availableCountries":["United States"],"availableStates":[],"availableWorldwide":false,"avgApprovedPublicReviewRating":5,"categoryAvailableCountries":["Canada"],"categoryName":"Cannabis","categorySlug":"cannabis","cbdContent":null,"cbdContentType":null,"countApprovedPublicReviews":1,"description":"Lemon Skunk is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid.

It's appearance is very dense buds with a dark green hue and monster red hairs encased with a thick layer of glistening trichomes. If you love your OG’s, this is going to be right up your alley.\nWhen it comes to the smell, it's an overwhelmingly dank goodness of a great OG. The spicy, pine aroma with lemon citrus notes of the OG resembles a box of fruit loops. The distinctive aroma is incredible and incomparable to most OG Kush’s. It has a lemony, sour fragrance combined with a pine and woody smell that only exists in an OG.  The taste is a powerful flavor of fruity pine accompanied by a strong lemony taste that lingers on the palate. Once this OG is opened, it fills the room with its woodsy, pine aroma. The smoke is incredible, definitely one of the more powerful of the hybrid strains.  The high comes on immediately, and it's intensely heady – melting into a body high providing you with a sense of ease. This is one of those strains you won’t get tired of.

Tartz - This refreshing hybrid cross of Runtz x Apple Fritter, redolent of crisp Granny Smith and sweet Honeycrisp, is sure to dazzle. Sour and tart, sharp and enlivening, evocative of those enormous perfectly green, perfectly ripened apples of your childhood - crisp and invigorating. Though like most, the metaphoric apple doesn't fall far from either side of the tree here - the Apple Tartz has a surprising sweetness that lingers for only a second, lent by the Runtz.

This mildly heady strain is perfect for new users and seasoned smokers alike due to the mild THC level and delicious taste and auroma. Smoking Pineapple Orange Guava will give you a creeping chill high that's characterized by an indica cerebral high with insane clarity and focus, followed by an indica warming body buzz. Be careful not to smoke too much at once – it will give you fits of giggles and make you a little more talkative than you should be in the average social situation. Because of its clarifying effects that encourage social interaction and subtle body high, this bud is perfect for treating social anxiety, stress disorders, and PTSD. Pineapple Orange Guava has sticky resinous minty green nugs of medium density that have a light layer of crystals and a slightly golden hue.\nhttp://www.cblabstesting.com/test-results/pineapple-orange-guava-2/","hasCurrentUserReviewed":null,"imageUrl":"https://leafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/products/photos/ZqZsngnQROOub7qDzvuw_pineapple.jpg","isAvailable":false,"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null,"msrp":35,"name":"Pineapple
